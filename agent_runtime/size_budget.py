"""One authoritative per-action size-budget table for agent contracts.

Every byte bound that shapes a model interaction is owned here so the bounds
can be proven coherent against each other instead of drifting apart in copies
(the R1/F1/F4/F5 size-contract audit class):

- Action output schemas (``agent_runtime/schemas/actions/*.json``) carry the
  CONTENT contract: per-field character maxima sized by what each field may
  legitimately hold. ``tests/test_size_budget.py`` asserts the schema files
  match the character maxima recorded here.
- ``max_final_bytes`` is the TRANSPORT contract: the canonical-encoding byte
  cap the bridge enforces on a delivered final value. Each action's cap MUST
  dominate the worst-case canonical encoding of any schema-valid value
  (``schema_worst_case_canonical_bytes``) plus ``FINAL_HEADROOM_BYTES``, so a
  schema-valid result can never be rejected by its own byte bound.
- ``repair_candidate_max_bytes`` bounds how much of a FAILED candidate is
  retained for the one correction/repair turn. Retention is truncation with an
  explicit marker, never a silent drop, so oversized delivered candidates stay
  correction-eligible in bounded form.
- Prompt budgets: an env-carried prompt (the pinned action lane re-packs
  ``prompt:`` into a single process string) must stay under the kernel's
  per-string ``execve`` limit ``MAX_ARG_STRLEN``; a compiled prompt artifact
  (the direct stdin lane) must stay under ``COMPILED_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES``. The
  NL repair prompt must fit BOTH lanes so the reviewed action-lane rollback
  profile keeps working: schema-valid candidates remain complete, while
  schema-invalid candidates are marker-truncated against the final packed
  prompt size.
- Inline-context budgets: the NL prompt inlines the card's trusted
  conversation history, so that history is bounded by turn count, per-turn
  bytes, and total bytes with explicit elision markers (the F1 E2BIG class).

Character-vs-byte accounting: JSON Schema ``maxLength`` counts characters,
while every cap here counts UTF-8 bytes of the canonical encoding
(``contract.canonical_json_bytes``, ``ensure_ascii=False``). One character
costs at most ``JSON_STRING_CHAR_MAX_BYTES`` = 6 encoded bytes (a control
character escapes to ``\\u00XX``; astral code points cost 4). The worst-case
walker uses that factor for unconstrained strings and exact ASCII character
classes for pattern-bound strings.

The deliberate router/schema contract changes recorded here:

- ``nl-decision-v1`` ``answer`` is capped at ``NL_ANSWER_MAX_CHARS`` and
  ``free_text`` at ``NL_FREE_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`` so the worst-case schema-valid
  candidate (111,129 canonical bytes) always fits the repair prompt COMPLETE
  in both repair lanes, using the reversible compact control-character
  transport when JSON-packing the canonical candidate would exceed the env
  lane. Longer replies were never postable ambitions: both fields are
  conversational text, and the caps stay far above observed use.
- ``deep-review-text-v1`` ``text`` is capped at ``GITHUB_COMMENT_MAX_CHARS``:
  a longer verdict could never post to the card (GitHub's comment bound), so
  schema-validity now matches consumer reality.

Consumers: ``task_builder.ACTION_LIMITS`` (task construction),
``claude_bridge`` (bridge validation, canonical output bounds, bounded
candidate retention), ``apply_decision`` (NL history budget, NL repair
candidate cap), ``render_card`` (triage repair candidate cap), ``worker``
(compiled prompt admission), ``consumer`` (result artifact reads), and the
v1alpha1 contract schemas (``maxFinalBytes`` / ``delivered.bytes`` /
``final.bytes`` ceilings). ``tests/test_size_budget.py`` holds the property
tests that keep every relationship above true.
