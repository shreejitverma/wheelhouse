# Wheelhouse

> A ship's **wheelhouse** is where the captain stands to steer. This is your wheelhouse for open-source maintenance: whatever across your repos needs *your* hand surfaces here, and you make the call.

A personal, always-on, cross-repo **"what needs my decision"** command center, built entirely on GitHub Issues + GitHub Actions.
Every issue in this repo is one pending decision about the repositories you maintain - a PR worth merging, a fork-CI run worth approving, an issue worth triaging.
You make final decisions by ticking a checkbox or replying in plain English; a workflow executes your call on the real repo and closes the card.
No server, no database, no bot to host - just this repo and a couple of secrets.

Fork it, edit one config file, add one required secret, and you have your own Wheelhouse.

Changing the Wheelhouse codebase itself goes through [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
PRs to `main` must be raised by `git push no-mistakes`, which writes the signature checked by the **"PR must be raised via no-mistakes"** workflow.

## How it works

- **The queue is the issue list.** Each open issue is one decision that needs you. Open = pending, closed = consumed.
- **Labels carry state:** `needs-decision` (in the queue), `processing` (a handler is acting), `resolved`, `blocked`, plus metadata labels `repo:<name>`, `kind:<pr-review|ci-approval|issue-triage>`, `priority:<high|med|low>`.
- **Each issue body is a decision card:** a link to the target, the situation, an overlap note, a recommended action, and quick-decision checkboxes. A hidden HTML comment holds the machine-readable state.
- **GitHub Actions are the handlers:** they create cards, refresh pending cards when their targets change, execute your decisions, and reconcile the queue against live repo state.

```

The deterministic core (ingest + decision-handler + scan-backstop) runs with a single secret and no LLM.
Two Claude-powered features layer on top, both needing only a Claude subscription token: **deep-review** is always available (tick a card's *Investigate* box for a code-grounded read of the target), and the opt-in `nl_decisions` lets you drive a card in plain English.

## Setup - a numbered checklist

Follow these top to bottom.
You only ever edit **one file** (`wheelhouse.config.yml`) and add **one required secret** (`FLEET_TOKEN`).

### 1. Fork it

Click **Fork** ▸ **Create a new fork** to copy this repo into your own account.
Keeping it **public** makes your decisions world-readable - a transparency feature; see [Security notes](#security-notes).
A **private** repo works too, in which case `FLEET_TOKEN` must also be able to read this repo's issues.

### 2. Edit `wheelhouse.config.yml`

This is the only file you edit.
The owner is **not** set here - every workflow derives it from `github.repository_owner`, so the file works unchanged on your account.
List the repos you maintain and how to read their checks:

```yaml
repos:
  - name: my-service                      # repo name only (resolved under your owner)
    compliance_check: "required-policy-check"  # exact name of a required gate check, or null
    test_check_patterns: ["test", "build", "e2e"]  # substrings that identify your test/CI checks
    # auto_approve_ci: false              # optional per-repo override
  - name: my-cli
    compliance_check: null
    test_check_patterns: ["ci", "test"]

maintainer: ""         # optional extra login allowed to drive decisions; default = repo owner
nl_decisions: false    # LLM side-job: reply to a card in plain English (off by default)
card_issues: false     # also card un-addressed issues, not just PRs (default: PRs only)
auto_approve_ci: true  # auto-approve provably-safe fork-CI runs (DEFAULT ON; see Security notes)
# (Deep review has no flag - it's always available once CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN is set.)
```

> **Heads-up - `auto_approve_ci` defaults ON.**
> When this key is absent it is treated as `true`, so a fresh fork auto-approves fork-CI runs that the security gate proves safe (no CI-file changes, the PR targets the repo default branch, no `pull_request_target` workflow, and all safety reads and approvals succeed) and only raises a card for risky or uncertain runs.
> Set it to `false` to opt out (every awaiting run raises a card, as you click to approve each), or add `auto_approve_ci: false` to a single `repos:` entry to opt that one repo out.
> See [Security notes](#security-notes).

Not sure what your check names are?
After step 6, run the `scan-backstop` workflow and read its logs, or use the `checks` helper locally:
`GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER=<you> GH_TOKEN=<token> python scripts/wheelhouse_core.py checks my-service`.

### 3. Create a `FLEET_TOKEN`

This is the token the machine uses to act on your other repos.
Only you can mint it (it's tied to your account).

1. GitHub ▸ **Settings** ▸ **Developer settings** ▸ **Personal access tokens** ▸ **Fine-grained tokens** ▸ **Generate new token**.
2. **Repository access** ▸ **Only select repositories** ▸ pick every repo you listed in `wheelhouse.config.yml` (and this repo too, if it is private).
3. **Permissions** ▸ Repository permissions: **Actions → Read and write**, **Contents → Read and write**, **Issues → Read and write**, **Pull requests → Read and write**.
4. Generate, copy the token.
5. In **this** repo: **Settings** ▸ **Secrets and variables** ▸ **Actions** ▸ **New repository secret** ▸ name it exactly `FLEET_TOKEN`, paste the value.

That is the only secret the deterministic machine needs.

### 4. (Optional) Add the Claude token for the LLM features

Skip this for the deterministic machine.
Two independent Claude-powered features share one token (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`):

- **Deep review (always-on)** - tick a card's *Investigate* box, or apply the `needs-deep-review` label, and Claude checks out the target's code read-only and posts a code-grounded merit/triage verdict. There is **no flag** - it runs whenever you trigger it, as long as the token is set. With the token missing it posts a one-line "needs token" note on the card so you know why nothing ran.
- **`nl_decisions` (opt-in)** - reply to a decision card in plain English and Claude maps it onto the existing actions (see [Daily use](#daily-use)). This one stays inert until `nl_decisions: true` **and** the token is present.

To set it up:

1. Generate a **Claude subscription** token (requires a Claude Pro/Max subscription): run `claude setup-token` in the Claude Code CLI.
   This is **not** an Anthropic API key - the workflows authenticate `anthropics/claude-code-action` with your subscription only.
2. Add it as an Actions secret named exactly `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
3. For the plain-English path, also set `nl_decisions: true` in `wheelhouse.config.yml`.

In every case Claude only ever reads your own text as instructions; the target diff/issue/code is passed (or checked out) as untrusted data, and it is given only this repo's token (never `FLEET_TOKEN`) - it proposes; the deterministic handler disposes.
Deep review goes a step further: it explores the target's checked-out code with read-only tools only (Read/Grep/Glob), with **no token left on disk** and **no ability to run the target's code**, so even a malicious PR can at worst produce a wrong verdict, never a compromise (see [Security notes](#security-notes)).

### 5. Onboard your repos

Two ways for items to enter the queue, and you can use either or both:

- **Fast path (recommended):** add a small dispatch workflow to each source repo so events push items here in real time.
  Copy-paste instructions are in [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/ONBOARDING.md).
- **Backstop only:** do nothing in the source repos and rely on the hourly `scan-backstop` to find items and keep pending cards current.

### 6. Verify

1. In this repo, open the **Actions** tab ▸ **scan-backstop** ▸ **Run workflow**.
2. Watch the run. Within a minute, decision-card issues should appear or refresh for anything in your fleet that needs your call.
3. Tick a consuming decision checkbox on one card and confirm the action lands on the target repo and the card closes.

If nothing appears, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Daily use

You drive the queue three ways - whichever fits the decision:

- **Quick calls - tick a consuming checkbox.** Each card offers the relevant final-decision boxes (e.g. *Merge it*, *Approve the CI run*, *Close / decline*, *Hold*). Tick exactly one; the handler executes it and closes the card.
- **Want a deeper look first? - tick *Investigate*.** PR-review and issue-triage cards also offer an *Investigate - deep code-grounded review* box. It is the one tick that **does not consume the card**: it kicks off a code-grounded deep review (Claude checks out the target's code read-only and posts a merit/triage verdict as a comment) and leaves the card open with the box cleared, so you can investigate again after new commits and still make your real call afterwards. (CI-approval cards don't offer it - that's a fast security gate, not a merit review.) It needs `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (see [step 4](#4-optional-add-the-claude-token-for-the-llm-features)); without it the card just gets a one-line "needs token" note. Applying the `needs-deep-review` label by hand does the same thing.
- **Nuanced calls - comment a slash-command.** Reply on the card with one of:
  - `/merge` - merge the target PR.
  - `/approve-ci` - approve the fork-CI run (security-gated; CI/action-file changes are held, while non-default bases and `pull_request_target` posture add warnings).
  - `/close` - close the target PR/issue.
  - `/decline <reason>` - post your reason on the target, then close it.
  - `/hold` - park the card (labels it `blocked`, leaves it for you to handle manually).
  - `/comment <text>` - post your comment to the target and leave the card open.
- **Plain English - just reply (opt-in).** When you turn on `nl_decisions` (see [step 4](#4-optional-add-the-claude-token-for-the-llm-features)), reply to a card in normal language and Claude maps what you meant onto the same actions above. It does one of three things:
  - **Acts** when you're clearly deciding - "merge it", "close this, it's superseded by #50", "decline because the approach is wrong". It runs that action on the target and closes the card, exactly as the slash-command would (same guards: per-kind allowlist, head-SHA re-check, fork-CI HOLD).
  - **Answers** when you're asking - "why is this safe to merge?", "what's the risk here?". It reads the target (diff/issue) and replies on the card, and **leaves the card open** so you can keep the thread going.
  - **Asks you to confirm** when it's unsure - so an ambiguous comment gets a reply instead of silence.

  Claude only ever *maps* your comment to a structured choice; the deterministic handler performs any action, so nothing happens that a slash-command couldn't already do. Only your own comments are ever read (a stranger's are ignored). A comment that starts with `/` is always treated as a slash-command, never sent to Claude. If Claude can't form a useful result, it asks you to rephrase or use a slash-command.

An item is **consumed** when the handler closes its card after acting; the card is labeled `resolved` (or `blocked` for a hold) for audit.
While a card is still a pure `needs-decision` card, a new dispatch or the hourly scan refreshes it in place when the target's material state changes: head SHA, compliance, tests, kind, priority, or checkbox options.
A head move also leaves a "target updated" comment so you know to re-review the card.
If you act before that refresh lands, a `/merge` (or a "merge it" comment) still refuses a stale head with a note.
The scheduled backstop also self-heals: if the underlying PR/issue gets merged or closed elsewhere, its card is closed automatically on the next scan.
If an open target no longer needs a maintainer decision, its pure pending card is closed too.
By default the scan also **auto-approves fork-CI runs it proves safe** (`auto_approve_ci`, on unless you opt out), so an *Approve the CI run* card now appears only for risky or uncertain cases - a run that changes CI/action files, targets a non-default base branch, has unreadable safety state, hits an approval error, or whose repo has a `pull_request_target` workflow (see [Security notes](#security-notes)).

## Security notes

- **Owner-only acting.** Anyone can open issues or comment on a public repo, but every acting path is owner-gated (`sender == repository_owner`, plus an optional `maintainer` override). Strangers' edits and comments are no-ops.
- **Token scope.** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only reaches this repo and is used for all card activity (so it can't recursively re-trigger the handler). Acting on your other repos uses `FLEET_TOKEN`, which is never printed and is only used in cross-repo scan, approval, execution, and read-only fetch steps. Scope it to just your fleet with Actions, Contents, Issues, and Pull requests read/write on the target repos.
- **Fork-CI / pwn-request HOLD.** Approving a fork PR's CI runs that PR's own workflow/action code with your permissions. Any approval that touches `.github/workflows`, `.github/actions`, or `action.yml`/`action.yaml` is **held** for manual review, never auto-approved (it fails closed if the file list can't be read).
- **Auto-approve of provably-safe fork CI (`auto_approve_ci`, DEFAULT ON).** To kill the repetitive "approve CI" clicks, the scan applies the *same* security gate *before* surfacing a card and auto-approves the runs it proves safe - so only risky or uncertain ones still raise a card.
  Auto-approve is a strict **subset** of the manual gate: a run is auto-cleared only when there are **no** CI-execution file changes (above), the PR targets the repo default branch, the target repo's default branch runs **no** `pull_request_target` workflow, and all safety reads and approval calls succeed.
  Every uncertainty fails closed to a card (unreadable PR files, a non-default PR base branch, unreadable workflows, or an approve error).
  It runs in the cross-repo `FLEET_TOKEN` scan step and never writes a card; nothing is ever silently approved or dropped.
  Set `auto_approve_ci: false` (globally or per repo) to disable it.
  - **The `pull_request_target` caveat (stated plainly).**
    This approval gates the fork's read-only `pull_request` CI run.
    A `pull_request_target` workflow runs **automatically with your repo's secrets regardless of any approval**, so Wheelhouse cannot gate that vector by withholding approval.
    What it *does* is refuse to *silently* auto-clear a repo that has such a workflow (it raises a card with a warning instead), and it flags **loudly** the genuine exploit shape - a `pull_request_target` workflow that also checks out the PR head (`ref: github.event.pull_request.head.*` / `github.head_ref`), which runs attacker-controlled code with your secrets.
    Treat that flag as a prompt to fix the upstream workflow, not as something this approval can contain.
- **LLM injection defense (both LLM features).** Only your own text ever reaches the LLM as instructions; the target diff/issue is passed as clearly-delimited untrusted data, and the LLM is never given `FLEET_TOKEN` or write access to a fleet repo. For `nl_decisions` the LLM only *maps* your comment to a structured choice that is re-validated against the per-kind action allowlist before the deterministic handler acts - so a prompt-injection in a target diff cannot make it merge or close anything you didn't ask for, and it is further restricted to a single file-writing tool (no shell, no `gh`).
- **Deep review is code-grounded but sandboxed.** To review the real code, deep review checks out the target repo into the runner using `FLEET_TOKEN` - but only for the clone, with `persist-credentials: false`, so **no token is ever written to disk**. The Claude step that follows gets only the model credential and this repo's token (never `FLEET_TOKEN`), and is restricted to **read-only** tools (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` plus `Write` for its verdict file) - it has **no shell and cannot build, test, install, or otherwise execute** the target's code. The verdict is posted by the workflow with the default token. So a malicious PR that tries to prompt-inject through its own source can at worst produce a wrong verdict comment - never run code or exfiltrate a secret. The trigger is owner-gated like every other acting path.
- **Public = world-readable.** A public Wheelhouse repo makes your queue and decisions visible to everyone. That transparency is a feature, but state it plainly to yourself before listing private work here; use a private repo if you need it.
- **Least privilege.** Every workflow declares a minimal `permissions:` block, and each card is serialized with per-issue `concurrency` so concurrent ticks can't race.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing shows up in the queue.**
  Check that `FLEET_TOKEN` exists and is scoped to the repos in `wheelhouse.config.yml` (Settings ▸ Secrets and variables ▸ Actions).
  Confirm the repo names in the config are correct (names only, no `owner/` prefix).
  Run `scan-backstop` manually and read the logs - a repo that can't be read is reported as a warning and skipped, not fatal.
- **Items look wrong (a non-compliant PR shows as merge-ready).**
  Your `compliance_check` / `test_check_patterns` don't match your actual check names.
  Run the `checks` helper (step 2) to see the real names, and the scan logs surface a config warning when a gate-like check is present but unconfigured.
- **A decision didn't execute.**
  Almost always `FLEET_TOKEN` scope: it needs Actions + Contents + Issues + Pull requests (read & write) on the **target** repo. The card stays open with an error comment when an action fails.
  A `/merge` that's refused with a "head moved" note is working as intended - re-scan and decide again.
- **Cron lag.**
  The scheduled keep-current path runs hourly, but GitHub cron is best-effort and can be delayed.
  For lower-latency items, wire the dispatch path from [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/ONBOARDING.md); dispatches nudge the same card-refresh logic immediately.
- **A plain-English reply did nothing / I only get slash-commands.**
  `nl_decisions` is inert unless `nl_decisions: true` **and** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set; the handler logs `nl path inert (...)` showing which condition is missing. Comments from anyone but the owner (or configured `maintainer`) are ignored, and a comment that starts with `/` is always treated as a slash-command.
- **Deep review does nothing.**
  It has no enable flag - it only needs `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. If that secret is missing, the card gets a one-line "Deep-review needs CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN configured to run." note instead of a verdict; add the secret (see [step 4](#4-optional-add-the-claude-token-for-the-llm-features)). If you ticked *Investigate* and nothing happened at all, confirm you're the repo owner (the trigger is owner-gated) and check the **deep-review** workflow run in the Actions tab.

## Prior art & lineage

This machine is an **IssueOps** system: GitHub Issues + Actions used as a human-in-the-loop control plane.
It leans on an established pattern rather than inventing one, and credits the people who shaped it.

- **IssueOps** - treat a GitHub issue as a structured request that Actions *parse*, *validate*, and *act* on - was popularized by **Nick Alteen** and GitHub.
  The [`issue-ops`](https://github.com/issue-ops) org ships reusable Actions for it (`parser`, `validator`, `labeler`) and a [docs site](https://issue-ops.github.io/docs/); GitHub's own introduction is [*IssueOps: Automate CI/CD (and more!) with GitHub Issues and Actions*](https://github.blog/engineering/issueops-automate-ci-cd-and-more-with-github-issues-and-actions/).
- **ChatOps ancestry.** IssueOps grew out of **ChatOps** - running ops from a shared, auditable conversation - a term coined by **Jesse Newland** at GitHub around 2013 ([talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github)) and built around **Hubot**, GitHub's chat bot (2011).
- Credit honestly: there is no single stamped "who coined IssueOps." Alteen and GitHub are the clear popularizers, and the term itself grew out of ChatOps.

### Where this machine sits in the pattern

Canonical IssueOps is *a human submits a form -> parse -> validate -> act*.
Wheelhouse is the **approval half** of that loop with an **automated front-end**: instead of you filling in a form, the scan/ingest workflows generate the decision cards, and you approve or deny them.
State lives in GitHub exactly as IssueOps intends - an open issue is a pending decision, a closed one is consumed, and labels carry the state in between.

### Lifecycle mapping

Our labels line up conceptually with the IssueOps lifecycle vocabulary - *Parse -> Validate -> Submit -> Approve -> Deny*:

- `needs-decision` - the card has been parsed and validated into the queue and is **awaiting your Approve / Deny**.
- `processing` - **Submit / acting**: a handler is executing your call against the target repo.
- `resolved` - **consumed**: the decision was carried out (merged, approved, or declined) and the card closed.
- `blocked` - **held**: a `/hold`, or a card parked for you to handle manually.

This is a correspondence to orient readers who already know the IssueOps vocabulary, **not** a rename - the labels in this repo are exactly those listed under [How it works](#how-it-works).
