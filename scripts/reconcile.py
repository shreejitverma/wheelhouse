"""
Wheelhouse - backstop reconciler.

The safety net behind the event-driven `ingest` path. Given a fresh scan of the
fleet (scan.json) and the current open cards in THIS repo (cards.json), it:

  * for any worklist item with no open card, safely reopens one uniquely
    trusted machine-soft-closed card or creates a new card, reads that card back
    by the issue number returned from `upsert_card`, and queues its first
    eligible auto-triage attempt in the same pass,
  * refreshes an OPEN `needs-decision` card in place when its target's material
    state changed (head_sha/compliance/tests/kind/priority/options), when its
    render version is stale, or when a held card should be published because
    auto triage is no longer eligible - so the queue reflects current state,
    not just the snapshot taken when the card was first created,
  * reflects target activity with a hidden state-only card body edit when the
    target's `updated_at` is newer than the card's `activity_reflected_at` and
    no full refresh or auto-triage queued write is already editing the body, and
  * queues lightweight automatic triage for eligible pure pending pr-review or
    issue-triage cards whose current revision lacks a `triaged_sha` cache
    (`pending-triage` held cards still count as pure pending), and
  * closes any open card whose underlying PR/issue is no longer open, and closes
    pure pending cards whose open target no longer needs a maintainer decision
    only after two adjacent scheduled workflow runs conclusively observe it
    absent - so any intervening inconclusive or present run breaks the streak.
    This also consumes old scan-built cards for owner/maintainer/bot-authored
    targets after the author filter removes them from the current worklist, and
    for conflicted PR-review targets after the scan moves them to needs-rebase.

Both card operations run against THIS repo via the ambient GH_TOKEN, which the
workflow sets to the default GITHUB_TOKEN (card activity must not re-trigger the
handler).

Usage:
  reconcile.py scan.json cards.json [automerge.json]

When automerge.json is present, its read-only `criteria` snapshot is attached to
matching PR-review items before rendering. Missing or historical files degrade
to explicit unavailable UI rows and never affect routing or acting.

cards.json is an array of open issue rows with number, body, labels, title, and
updated_at.
