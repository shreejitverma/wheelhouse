"""Bounded display-only migration for cards the observation-bound writer cannot reach.

A PR-review card body is an observation-bound projection, so `upsert_card`
refuses to re-render one whose current target observation is incomplete
(`defer card refresh ...: current PR observation is unavailable`). That
whole-card guard is correct and is NOT touched here. Its side effect is that a
card parked in `ci-state-unknown` is excluded from every display-only renderer
migration for as long as it stays unobservable: the five `no-mistakes` cards the
`CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 11 -> 12 canonical-recommendation migration left behind had
already missed 8 -> 9, 9 -> 10, and 10 -> 11 exactly the same way.

This closes that gap and nothing else. The default migration REMOVES retired
recommendation presentation - the deterministic check-derived `### Recommended
action` section and the action-bearing `Recommended next step` bullet inside
`### Triage` - from an explicit operator-supplied cohort. The
`stale-accept-recommendation` migration is a separate deletion-only mode: it
removes exactly the renderer-inserted Accept checkbox only when the shipped
`accept_recommendation_available` gate is false for the card's parsed state.

Boundaries, enforced in code rather than by convention (the pure transform,
diff allowlist, invariant check, and the single verified writer all live in
`render_card.py` beside the rule they except):

  * Deletions only. The allowlist rejects any added or modified line, so this
    can never fabricate Situation, target facts, criteria, or a recommendation.
  * The hidden state block must be byte-identical, preserving hidden authority
    state and every observation-derived field exactly.
  * `render_version` is deliberately NOT advanced: the observation-bound
    migration did not run, so the card stays render-stale and a later complete
    observation still performs the ordinary full renderer migration.
  * Title, labels, options, target, and model cache are never written; the only
    write is one issue-body edit under the ambient default card token.
  * Every member is preflighted, including an exact live target-head match,
    before any write, and one ambiguous member denies the entire run.
  * Dry-run is the default; writing requires an explicit `--apply`.
  * Idempotent by content: a card with no retired surface is a no-op.

It never hand-edits outside those transformations, never clears valid card data,
never replays model triage, and never touches a target pull request.
