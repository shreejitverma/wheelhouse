Wheelhouse - decision executor.

Phases, run as separate workflow steps so each uses the right token:

  parse        Determine the decision from a deterministic event (checkbox tick,
               slash-command, or decision:<key> label). No side effects, no
               token. Writes decision/target to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The checkbox
               tick is read from issue-ops/parser output (the `{selected,
               unselected}` JSON for the card's new and old body) - this script
               only diffs the parsed option keys, it no longer scrapes the body.
               A held `pending-triage` card is intentionally inert until
               render_card.py publishes its first auto-triage result.
               The virtual accept-recommendation checkbox is parsed only from
               fresh successful structured triage_recommendation state, then
               mapped to an existing deterministic action.
               The NON-CONSUMING `investigate` tick is routed apart from every
               other action: it sets `investigate` (not `decision`) so the
               handler triggers deep-review.yml and leaves the card OPEN.

  execute      Act on the TARGET repo (merge / approve-ci / close / decline /
               comment / request-changes) using the ambient GH_TOKEN, which the
               workflow sets to FLEET_TOKEN for this step. A successful
               request-changes action may also arm deterministic stale
               pending-contributor cleanup by writing target-side state.
               Writes result_message/terminal_state to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.

  clear-checkbox  Print $ISSUE_BODY_FILE (or $ISSUE_BODY) with the $OPT_KEY
               checkbox un-ticked, so the handler can rewrite a card after a
               non-consuming action and keep it re-triggerable. No token, no
               side effects.

Natural-language phases (gated on nl_decisions + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN):

  nl-eligible  Print true/false: is this owner/maintainer comment eligible for
               the LLM intent-mapper? (a decision card AND not held AND not a
               slash-command).

  nl-prompt    Build the LLM prompt: the deterministic card context + the
               owner/maintainer's comment (trusted instructions) plus the target
               content as clearly-delimited UNTRUSTED data. Writes `prompt` to
               $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The card's advisory auto-triage section and
               hidden triage_recommendation state are omitted from trusted
               context. The card's
               prior comment thread is folded in as owner-scoped conversation
               history (see assemble_history) so follow-up questions keep
               continuity. When the workflow has an optional READONLY_TOKEN, it
               also tells the LLM it may use the read-only wheelhouse-search
               wrapper for answer context only.

  nl-route     Read the LLM's STRUCTURED result (decision.json:
               {mode, action?, free_text?, answer?}) and emit deterministic
               outputs. The LLM only MAPS intent; this phase validates the
               action against the per-kind allowlist and hands `action` mode to
               the SAME `execute` above (inheriting every guard). `answer`/
               `clarify` modes just post a card comment and leave the card open.

Security: the caller owner/maintainer-gates the whole job; only
owner/maintainer-authored text ever reaches this script (and the LLM). Merge and
request-changes re-check the PR head SHA against the card's state block and
refuse if the PR moved. Card-driven merge also pre-detects `.github/workflows/**`
touches (net diff or PR commit history, including either side of a rename) and
returns terminal `blocked` with
manual UI-merge guidance instead of attempting a doomed API merge - FLEET_TOKEN
intentionally has no Workflows write. request-changes cleanup arming is best-effort and
fail-open: if the review posts but the target-side marker cannot be proven or
written, the card still stays open with a cleanup-only note. approve-ci routes
through the shared CI safety verdict:
CI/action-file changes hard-hold, while non-default bases and
`pull_request_target` posture add warnings, and each awaiting workflow run is
bound to the PR by strict pull_requests association or fork fallback head SHA
plus branch matching. Duplicate verified runs sharing a stable workflow identity
are collapsed to the newest run before approval.
The LLM never receives FLEET_TOKEN.
Without READONLY_TOKEN it never runs shell commands; with READONLY_TOKEN it may
run the read-only search wrapper for answer context only, and can still only
return the structured result that this deterministic code acts on.

    offered it, and if it hallucinated one it would be downgraded to clarify.
