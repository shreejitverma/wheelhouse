Wheelhouse - decision executor.

Phases, run as separate workflow steps so each uses the right token:

  parse        Determine the decision from a deterministic event (checkbox tick,
               slash-command, or decision:<key> label). No side effects, no
               token. Writes decision/target to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The checkbox
               tick is read from issue-ops/parser output (the `{selected,
               unselected}` JSON for the card's new and old body) - this script
               only diffs the parsed option keys, it no longer scrapes the body.
               A held `pending-triage` card is intentionally inert until
               render_card.py publishes its first auto-triage result.
               The NON-CONSUMING `investigate` tick is routed apart from every
               other action: it sets `investigate` (not `decision`) so the
               handler triggers deep-review.yml and leaves the card OPEN.

  execute      Act on the TARGET repo (merge / approve-ci / close / decline /
               comment / request-changes) using the ambient GH_TOKEN, which the
               workflow sets to FLEET_TOKEN for this step. Writes
               result_message/terminal_state to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.

  clear-checkbox  Print $ISSUE_BODY_FILE (or $ISSUE_BODY) with the $OPT_KEY
               checkbox un-ticked, so the handler can rewrite a card after a
               non-consuming action and keep it re-triggerable. No token, no
               side effects.

Natural-language phases (gated on nl_decisions + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN):

  nl-eligible  Print true/false: is this owner/maintainer comment eligible for
               the LLM intent-mapper? (a decision card AND not held AND not a
               slash-command).

  nl-prompt    Build the LLM prompt: the deterministic card context + the
               owner/maintainer's comment (trusted instructions) plus the target
               content as clearly-delimited UNTRUSTED data. Writes `prompt` to
               $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The card's advisory auto-triage section is omitted
               from trusted context. The card's
               prior comment thread is folded in as owner-scoped conversation
               history (see assemble_history) so follow-up questions keep
               continuity. When the workflow has an optional READONLY_TOKEN, it
               also tells the LLM it may use the read-only wheelhouse-search
               wrapper for answer context only.

  nl-route     Read the LLM's STRUCTURED result (decision.json:
               {mode, action?, free_text?, answer?}) and emit deterministic
               outputs. The LLM only MAPS intent; this phase validates the
               action against the per-kind allowlist and hands `action` mode to
               the SAME `execute` above (inheriting every guard). `answer`/
               `clarify` modes just post a card comment and leave the card open.

Security: the caller owner/maintainer-gates the whole job; only
owner/maintainer-authored text ever reaches this script (and the LLM). Merge and
request-changes re-check the PR head SHA against the card's state block and
refuse if the PR moved. approve-ci routes through the shared CI safety verdict:
CI/action-file changes hard-hold, while non-default bases and
`pull_request_target` posture add warnings, and each awaiting workflow run is
bound to the PR by strict pull_requests association or fork fallback head SHA
plus branch matching. The LLM never receives FLEET_TOKEN. Without READONLY_TOKEN
it never runs shell commands; with READONLY_TOKEN it may run the read-only search
wrapper for answer context only, and can still only return the structured result
that this deterministic code acts on.
