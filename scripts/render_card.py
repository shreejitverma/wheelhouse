Wheelhouse - decision-card renderer + card operations.

`render(item)` turns one classified item into a decision card: a human-readable
body with quick-decision checkboxes (or a held auto-triage placeholder) and a
hidden machine-readable state block.
`upsert_card`/`reflect_activity`/`close_card` create, refresh, activity-stamp,
or consume cards in THIS repo (via the ambient GH_TOKEN, which the workflow
sets to the default GITHUB_TOKEN so that card-side activity never re-triggers
the handler).

When auto triage is enabled (`should_hold`), a brand-new pr-review/issue-
triage card is created HELD - `pending-triage` on top of `needs-decision`, a
placeholder body with no checkboxes - and published to its normal actionable
form by `update_card_triage` the moment its first auto-triage attempt
completes, success or failure alike. See "Held cards" above `HOLD_LABEL`.
Fresh successful structured triage recommendations can add a conditional
`Accept recommendation` checkbox and persist `triage_recommendation` in the
state block; the visible Markdown recommendation text is never parsed for this.

CLI:
  render_card.py upsert --item-file item.json    create-or-refresh a card (dedup by marker)
  render_card.py render --item-file item.json --out-dir DIR    debug: write title/body/labels
  render_card.py queue-triage --item-file item.json [--issue N]    mark triage queued and dispatch triage.yml when eligible
  render_card.py triage-apply --issue N --revision REV --execution-file FILE    update the card from Claude output
  render_card.py triage-fail --issue N --revision REV --message TEXT    write the auto-triage unavailable section
  render_card.py triage-recover --issue N --kind KIND --revision REV    fail-open safety net: publish a held card still stuck "queued" for REV

REV is a PR's head SHA (pr-review) or an issue's `updatedAt` (issue-triage) -
whichever revision the auto-triage cache is keyed on for that card's kind.
When `upsert` runs under GitHub Actions it writes `issue=N` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`;
pass that number to `queue-triage --issue N` so a newly-created card is read
back by number instead of through the read-after-write-racy label listing.

# A card carrying any of these is past the pure pending state: the owner has a
# decision in flight (`processing`), the card is consumed (`resolved`), or the
# owner parked it (`blocked`, via the `/hold` decision). Re-rendering the body
# resets its checkboxes, which would clobber an in-progress decision or race
# the decision-handler - so full refresh and activity reflection SKIP a card
# with any of these. Only a pure `needs-decision` card is maintained this way.
NON_REFRESHABLE_LABELS = frozenset({"processing", "resolved", "blocked"})

# A held card (see "Held cards" below) ALSO carries `needs-decision` and is
# therefore refreshable/triage-eligible like any other pure pending card -
# `HOLD_LABEL` is deliberately absent from `NON_REFRESHABLE_LABELS` because
# triage.yml's resolve step requires `needs-decision` to still be a pure,
# refreshable card in order to run at all (see `should_hold`/`update_card_triage`).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Held cards (visibility gated on the first auto-triage attempt completing)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# When a brand-new pr-review/issue-triage card is eligible for auto triage
# (`should_hold`), it is created HELD: `needs-decision` stays (triage.yml needs
# it), `HOLD_LABEL` is added on top, and the body's "Your decision" section is
# a placeholder with no checkboxes (`_held_decision_lines` - no `<!-- opt:* -->`
# markers, so it is inert to the decision handler; see `cmd_parse`/
# `cmd_nl_eligible` in apply_decision.py, which also short-circuit on the
# state block's `held` flag as defense in depth). This is a deliberately
# DIFFERENT concept from the `/hold` decision action (which parks a card under
# the `blocked` label) - do not conflate the two.
#
# A held card is published - checkboxes appear, `HOLD_LABEL` is removed - the
# moment its own auto-triage ATTEMPT completes, via `update_card_triage`
# (called by both `triage-apply` on success and `triage-fail` on error/
# timeout - fail-open by construction, never gated on triage succeeding).
# Publishing is keyed to the card's own current revision
# (`state_revision`/`triage_revision`): if the card was refreshed to a newer
# revision while the attempt was in flight, that stale attempt's completion is
# a no-op (the fresh revision's own queued attempt - `should_auto_triage`
# always requeues on a revision change - will publish the card when it
# completes instead), exactly mirroring how a stale triage result is already
# dropped for a published card.
#
# `held` is carried as a non-material key in the state block (like
# `triaged_sha`/`triage_status`): it is never in `MATERIAL_FIELDS` and never
# affects classify/material_changed/decision-parsing/target-execution/
# fork-CI-safety/author-filtering/conflict-routing. `HOLD_LABEL` is a display/
# filtering label kept in sync with it (added by `card_labels` whenever
# `render()` is called with `held=True`), never read back as the source of
# truth - `state["held"]` is. A refresh preserves held-ness only while the
# refreshed item still qualifies for auto triage; otherwise it renders the card
# actionable in the same refresh. `update_card_triage` publishes held cards when

    """Create a new card, or refresh the existing one for this target in place.

    `has_token` gates whether a BRAND-NEW eligible card is created HELD (see
    "Held cards" above / `should_hold`) - pass the same
    `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`-presence signal used to gate whether auto triage
    is queued at all (`auto_triage_has_token()`). On refresh, a currently-held
    card stays held only if the refreshed item still passes `should_hold`.

    Refresh rules (see AGENTS.md "Card refresh"):
      * Only a pure `needs-decision` card is refreshed; a card already
        `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked` is left untouched (never rewrite a
        decision in flight - re-rendering the body would reset its checkboxes).
      * A refresh runs when a MATERIAL field changed, the card's stored
        `render_version` is behind `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` (a one-time, self-
        terminating re-render for display-only fixes and card-body repairs like
        cached triage ref qualification or automated-status labeling), or a
        held card must be published because auto triage is no longer eligible;
        these are full-card refreshes.
      * If no full refresh or auto-triage queued write is needed, but the
        target's `updated_at` is newer than the hidden `activity_reflected_at`
        stamp, `reflect_activity` edits only the state block so GitHub's
        recently-updated issue sort sees the target activity. If that stamp is
        fresh too, the card is a full no-op (no body edit, no label churn, no
        comment).
      * On refresh the wheelhouse-managed labels (`repo:`/`kind:`/`priority:`/
        `target:`) are REPLACED so stale ones are removed, and a head-SHA change
        also drops a short "target updated" comment. A held card whose refreshed
        item no longer qualifies for auto triage is rendered actionable in that
        same refresh.

    Always returns an int issue number (new or existing), or None if a
    brand-new card's number could not be parsed from `gh issue create`'s
    output. Callers needing the fresh card back MUST read it by this number
    (e.g. `get_card`/`current_card`) - a label-filtered `find_card` listing is
    not read-after-write consistent immediately after creation."""
