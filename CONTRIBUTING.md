# Contributing to Wheelhouse

Every change to this repository is raised through [no-mistakes](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes), the local git proxy that validates code before it reaches `main`.
Wheelhouse dogfoods the same contribution gate it applies to the rest of the fleet: the `no-mistakes-required.yml` workflow runs a check named **"PR must be raised via no-mistakes"** on every PR to `main`, and that check passes only for PRs the no-mistakes pipeline opened.

## How to submit a change

1. Make your change on a branch (never commit directly to `main`).
2. Run the pipeline instead of pushing by hand:

   ```
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

   no-mistakes runs the required review/test/lint/CI steps, then opens (or updates) the PR and writes a deterministic `## Pipeline` section into the PR body.
   That section carries the signature the gate looks for:

   ```
   Updates from [git push no-mistakes](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes)
   ```

3. Let the checks finish, then merge through the normal PR flow.

A PR opened directly on GitHub (without the no-mistakes signature in its body) fails the **"PR must be raised via no-mistakes"** check and cannot be merged.
Automated authors are exempt: PRs from `github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, and `release-please[bot]` skip the gate.

## Pull requests from forks

If you open a pull request from a fork, use a personal fork and enable **Allow edits from maintainers** in the pull request sidebar. This permission is required for the planned captain-initiated path that will resolve a small conflict on that same branch without asking you to rebase. That assisted path is not enabled in Phase 0; until it ships, the captain handles conflicts manually. The planned path will not rewrite your existing commits, and checks will run on the same PR.

GitHub does not allow organization-owned forks to grant this permission. Pull requests from a fork that cannot be updated by maintainers are closed with an explanation. You can enable the setting and reopen the PR, or send a replacement from a personal fork.

If GitHub shows **Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers**, read GitHub's warning before enabling it. That setting has the security implications GitHub documents for fork workflows. Do not enable it if you do not accept those implications. In that case, this contribution policy cannot accept the fork PR.

## Setting up the repository itself

If you are forking Wheelhouse to run your own queue rather than changing this codebase, follow the numbered checklist in the [README](README.md#setup---a-numbered-checklist) instead.
That covers the fleet config, the `FLEET_TOKEN` secret, and the agent-assisted features.
