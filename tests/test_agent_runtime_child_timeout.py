"""Regression: claude-action-compat child execution timeout covers job overhead.

Production card #1759 (run 30248637187): the reusable model job's GitHub
Actions timeout is measured from job start, but the job spends a measured
~30-40s before the model starts (handoff hydration, checkpoint, action setup,
Claude Code install, SDK init) plus post-model capture/upload time. With
``childExecutionTimeoutMs = ceil(hard / 60000) * 60000`` the triage.pr lane's
enforced model budget was only 360s - ~36s = ~324s, BELOW its designed 330s
hard budget. The job timeout killed the claude-code-action mid-execution at
6m16s, before it could commit its execution file, and the card landed on
``consumer.committed.primary.output.missing`` with no triage for its current
head. The near-miss control (run 30254186583, model finished at ~324s) proves
the boundary: its action committed the execution file seconds before the same
timeout fired and its card received an admitted assessment.

Every claude-action-compat lane carries ``CLAUDE_ACTION_JOB_OVERHEAD_MS`` on
top of its whole-minute hard budget, mirroring the two-minute setup/upload
allowance the ``claude-model-call`` composite action has always documented
for the claude-cli lane.

The pr-review triage lane is additionally TOTAL-FIRST by captain decision
(the card #1759 missing-triage campaign): ``TRIAGE_PR_CHILD_TOTAL_MS`` fixes
the whole child job at exactly 15 minutes because agents can be slow, the
overhead allowance lives INSIDE that total, and the lane's hard
model-execution budget is derived as total minus allowance. This supersedes
the interim 8-minute total that PR #1790 landed for this lane.
