"""
Offline regression guard for the PASS-BY-REFERENCE natural-language decision
prompt (decision-handler.yml NL path). NO network, NO live gh, NO live LLM.

Background: card #555. An owner posted a plain-English question on a decision
card whose target PR (firstmate#442) had a ~1.2 MB diff. The NL path's
`nl-fetch` step wrote that whole diff into `target.txt`, and
`apply_decision.build_nl_prompt` read it back and INLINED it into the Claude
action's `prompt:` input. claude-code-action re-packs `prompt:` into a single
`ALL_INPUTS` env string; JSON-escaping the diff-heavy prompt pushed it past the
kernel's per-string `execve` limit `MAX_ARG_STRLEN = 131072`, so `/bin/bash`
would not spawn (E2BIG). The Claude step died, every downstream step was
skipped, and the card was left silently untouched under a red run. This is the
SAME class PR #544 structurally eliminated for triage.yml / deep-review.yml -
the NL path was never converted.

The fix makes the NL prompt PR-SIZE-INDEPENDENT: `nl-fetch` writes the bounded
title/body/diff to the on-disk `target.txt`, and the small constant prompt only
NAMES that file and directs the agent to Read/Grep/Glob it. Huge PR content
never enters the action prompt / ALL_INPUTS again. Read/Grep/Glob are added to
both NL Claude steps' allowed tools (the write/acting boundary is unchanged).

These tests encode that as a STRUCTURAL INVARIANT (the prompt cannot grow with
target size) which a lowered cap could never guarantee, plus a faithful
end-to-end reproduction: a synthetic 5 MB target on disk still yields a tiny
prompt. They follow the repo's static-inspection style (see
test_triage_prompt_size.py / test_workflow_lint.py).

Run: python tests/test_nl_prompt_size.py   (needs PyYAML, which the workflows
install)
