"""
Card #556 regression: a valid Claude auto-triage verdict must NEVER be
discarded because the execution transcript is bulky.

This is the delivered-then-dropped defect. Under the pass-by-reference triage
design (#544) the agentic transcript legitimately grows into the hundreds of
KB (every file the model Reads is recorded), so triage.yml's old copy step
dropped the whole execution file when it exceeded 262144 bytes - throwing away
a successful, already-produced structured result. The fix is STRUCTURAL, not a
bigger magic cap: `render_card.extract_result_to_file` extracts the compact
final result BEFORE any transcript-size enforcement, so transcript bulk can
never gate result delivery. A size cap still bounds only the retained debug
transcript copy.

Run: python tests/test_triage_result_delivery.py
