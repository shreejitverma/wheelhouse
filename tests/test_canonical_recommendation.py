"""One canonical Wheelhouse recommendation surface (card #1746).

Every check here is offline: no network call, no live card or target is read or
mutated, and no model runs. The fixtures reproduce the exact production shape
recorded for decision card #1746 / firstmate#1089 (head `91be95d3...`, delivered
candidate `valueSha256 1c947887...`):

- bucket `merge-ready`, compliance pass, configured checks green,
- an advisory `### Triage` result whose prose recommends merge,
- `recommendation_basis.kind = "configured-tests"` (a kind that does not exist),
- `automerge.optin_default_off` omitted,
- primary `output.schema_invalid`, admission `basis.missing_or_invalid`,
- no admitted assessment and therefore no authority-bearing recommendation.

The product rule proven here: a recommendation is presented ONLY when it comes
from a current admitted structured agent-triage result, in exactly one place.
There is no deterministic check-derived recommendation, and a delivered but
invalid or non-admitted candidate never has its advisory action presented as the
agent's recommendation.
