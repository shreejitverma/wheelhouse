"""
The context-equivalent single correction turn plus the evidence-quote UTF-8
byte policy (cards #551/#547 lineage; card #1693 byte-policy class).

Any DELIVERED triage candidate that fails the complete bound action schema,
the evidence-quote byte policy, or trusted evidence anchoring - including
candidates the looser advisory parser can consume - is eligible for exactly
ONE correction turn: the ORIGINAL AgentTask rebuilt from its verified handoff
(same action, model, tools, search, network boundaries, and immutable inputs)
with the rejected candidate and every trusted validation error appended to the
original prompt. Missing results and infrastructure failures (auth / quota /
rate-limit / transport / sandbox / timeout / provider) never enter correction.
The corrected result is revalidated through the same trusted guards before any
authority; a failed correction leaves an advisory-consumable original
explicitly advisory-only, and anything less records the visible
triage-unavailable error carrying the structural reason. The legacy no-tool
repair helpers remain only for the disabled codex inline evidence branch.

These tests are OFFLINE: pure helpers, mocked card I/O, the real bridge over
synthetic transcripts, and static YAML inspection - the live LLM turn is only
exercised end-to-end in CI.
