"""
Offline regression guard for the PASS-BY-REFERENCE triage / deep-review prompt
architecture. NO network, NO live gh, NO live LLM.

Background: card #517 (and every other large-diff card) failed because the
triage / deep-review prompt INLINED the target PR diff (`cat target.txt` into
`prompt.txt`). claude-code-action re-packs its `prompt:` input into a single
`ALL_INPUTS` env var; JSON-escaping a diff-heavy prompt pushed it past the
kernel's per-string `execve` limit `MAX_ARG_STRLEN = 131072`, so `/usr/bin/bash`
would not even spawn (E2BIG) and no triage ran.

The fix makes the prompt PR-SIZE-INDEPENDENT: the runner pre-fetches the
authoritative title/body/diff (at the verified revision) into the on-disk
`target.txt`, checks out the code at `target-src/`, and the small constant
prompt NAMES those files and directs the agent to Read/Grep/Glob them. Huge PR
content never enters the action prompt / ALL_INPUTS again.

These tests encode that as a STRUCTURAL INVARIANT (prompt cannot grow with PR
size), which a lowered diff cap could never guarantee. They follow the repo's
static-YAML-inspection style (see test_workflow_lint.py / test_auto_merge_v1.py).

Run: python tests/test_triage_prompt_size.py   (needs PyYAML, which the
workflows install)
