"""Confirming/inert cards must not instruct ticking an absent Accept control.

Production defect (scan 5 / card #1721): an issue-triage card entered the
`wheelhouse:confirming-target-state` lifecycle while carrying a fresh admitted
recommendation. The confirming projection correctly suppressed every decision
checkbox and correctly kept the recommendation analysis, but
`_recommendation_section` still appended "Tick **Accept recommendation** to
apply it" - instructing the captain to operate a control that is not rendered.

All checks here are offline: no network, no live card or target mutation.
