# Project agent memory

Wheelhouse - a portable, forkable IssueOps machine. Issues in this repo are a
human-in-the-loop decision queue for cross-repo OSS maintenance, driven entirely
by GitHub Actions. This file holds durable, project-intrinsic notes.

The name: a ship's wheelhouse is where the captain steers. This repo is where
you steer your open-source maintenance - what needs your hand surfaces as a card
and you make the call. (The product is "Wheelhouse"; the generic verb "triage"
still appears where it's plain English, e.g. "triage the queue".)

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Portability / fork-and-own.** Never hardcode an owner or repo name in
  workflows or scripts. Owner is always `github.repository_owner` (env
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`); the fleet + policy come from the single root file
  `wheelhouse.config.yml`. A fork on any account must work after editing only that
  file and adding the secrets.
- **Security.** Owner-gate every acting path (`sender == repository_owner`, plus
  optional `maintainer` override via `wheelhouse_core.py authorized`). Cross-repo
  actions use `FLEET_TOKEN`; everything that touches THIS repo's cards uses the
  default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (this is also what prevents the decision-handler from
  re-triggering itself - GitHub does not raise workflow events for
  GITHUB_TOKEN-authored activity). The fork-CI / pwn-request HOLD (exit 4 in
  `approve_ci`) must never be removed: approving fork CI that changes
  `.github/workflows`, `.github/actions`, or `action.yml(.yaml)` is held for
  manual review and fails closed. **Scan-time auto-approve is a STRICT SUBSET of
  the manual gate**: it shares the one `ci_safety` verdict and approves only what
  is provably safe (no risky files AND no `pull_request_target` posture, all reads
  fail closed), so it can never auto-clear anything the manual path would HOLD.

## Architecture

- **State lives in GitHub, not on disk.** Open issue = pending decision; closed =
  consumed. Labels are state (`needs-decision`, `pending-triage`, `processing`,
  `resolved`, `blocked`, `wheelhouse:manual-merge-required`,
  `wheelhouse:confirming-target-state`, `repo:*`, `kind:*`, `priority:*`). A hidden
  `<!-- wheelhouse-state: {...} -->` block in each card body carries
  `{repo, number, kind, head_sha, options}` plus the material fields
  `{comp, tests, priority, bucket, projection_freshness, projection_head_sha,
  projection_complete, pushability}` so a refresh can cheaply and deterministically
  decide
  "did this target or its current-tense projection contract materially change?"
  - see "Card refresh" in Sharp edges. `options` is also material for refresh comparison,
  but is normalized as a sorted set so checkbox reordering alone does not
  refresh the card. The state block also carries `updated_at` unconditionally
  (populated for issue-triage items, empty for pr-review) - it is NON-material,
  existing as the issue-triage auto-triage cache key and strict newer-only
  deterministic refresh stamp, mirroring how `head_sha` doubles as the
  pr-review cache key. PR cards may also carry a versioned, non-churn-triggering
  `projection_ref` with observation ID/time/source, target/head identity,
  completeness, freshness, and bucket. Its semantic head/completeness/freshness/
  bucket dimensions are the material fields above; a newer observation ID/time
  alone does not rewrite an otherwise unchanged card. The state block also carries
  `activity_reflected_at`, a NON-material target-activity sort stamp. When a
  target's GitHub `updatedAt` advances past that stamp, Wheelhouse may make one
  hidden state-only card body edit so GitHub's `sort:updated-desc` issue view
  surfaces recently active targets first. That stamp is never part of
  `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, never a triage revision, and never a decision input. Cards
  written before the stamp existed use the card issue's own GitHub `updatedAt`
  as the baseline, so legacy queues do not churn just to backfill the stamp.
  Automatic triage (pr-review
  AND issue-triage) adds non-material cache fields such as
  `triaged_sha`, `triage_status`, `triage_recommendation`, and the bounded
  schema-repair telemetry `triage_repair_status`/`triage_repair_reason` (see
  "Context-equivalent single correction turn" in Sharp edges); those are
  deliberately outside `MATERIAL_FIELDS` so a triage result never changes
  classification or forces a card refresh. The auto-inserted
  `accept-recommendation` option is stripped from material option comparisons
  because it is derived from non-material triage state, not from source-provided
  checkbox options. A held card also carries non-material `held: true` until its
  first auto-triage attempt publishes the normal decision controls. The state
  block may also carry a bounded, versioned, head-scoped NON-material
  `automerge_workflow_hold` record after the authoritative final auto-merge gate
  proves a history-only workflow touch against a complete clean net diff.
  Its matching managed `wheelhouse:manual-merge-required` label and visible
  section deny repeated claims without making the refreshable card generically
  `blocked`; malformed same-head state fails closed, while authoritative
  new-head or incompatible-kind rendering clears it.
  The state
  block also carries `render_version`, another
  non-material field alongside `triaged_sha`: it is a one-time re-render
  trigger stamped by `render()` (see "Card refresh" in Sharp edges) that exists
  purely so a display-only fix (e.g. the author `@mention` drop or automated
  status labeling) propagates to already-open cards; it is never a
  `MATERIAL_FIELDS` member and never
  influences classification. `render_card.py` writes that marker.
  Reconcile may also add one bounded, versioned, NON-material `reconcile_absence` record to a pure pending card after a complete scheduled observation finds its still-open target outside the worklist.
  The fixed threshold is two adjacent trusted scheduled-observation epochs from `scripts/scheduled_epoch.py`; manual runs never advance or reset it, and unavailable bookkeeping delays closure.
  The first observation is a complete visible inert projection with `wheelhouse:confirming-target-state`, reason, no controls, and `lifecycle-transition` cause; a PR-review projection also carries the exact ReviewObservation. The threshold record includes exact trusted machine soft-close provenance before close; malformed, duplicate, wrong-version, boolean, negative, oversized, or otherwise untrusted state reads as count zero and can never accelerate close or qualify future reuse.
  When no open card exists, `render_card.lookup_card_lifecycle` completely lists the exact target label and may reuse a closed card only when its strict state identity, managed target/repo labels, issue author, latest close actor, close timing, terminal labels, and current-schema soft-close provenance are independently trustworthy.
  A later `updatedAt` is reusable only when a bounded complete issue-timeline read proves every post-close event came from trusted Wheelhouse automation and fully explains the timestamp; unreadable, incomplete, ambiguous, or human-touched history refuses reuse.
  If several trusted candidates share the exact identity, Wheelhouse selects the highest issue number deterministically and reports the lower candidates as superseded without changing them; any identity disagreement still fails closed.
  Legacy, owner/decision-resolved, blocked, held, hard-target-closed, auto-merged/audit-protected, manually authored, malformed, target-mismatched, and ambiguous closed cards are never reopened.
  A reusable card is rendered and relabeled while still closed, re-read before reopening, then checked through a complete trusted-open lookup; a partial failure stays closed, and post-open ambiguity rolls the local card back closed.
  New-head or incompatible-kind rendering naturally drops stale triage, recommendation, verdict, criteria, held, audit, and absence state; same-revision triage is preserved only through the normal `_preserve_same_revision_triage` path.
  A conclusive worklist return clears the record while reusing the open card.
  Definitive target closure remains an immediate hard close and clears any uniquely parsed absence record first so hard-close cards cannot later satisfy reuse provenance, while `ok:false`, truncated, CI-wait, audit-protected, and owner/handler-raced cards remain frozen.
  Every reconcile mutation and close re-reads the live card and requires it to match the scan snapshot.
  `ingest`, `decision-handler`, `triage`, and `scan-backstop` share the queued `wheelhouse-backstop` concurrency group, and create/reopen still performs a post-write uniqueness check, so the event and global paths cannot mint two actionable cards for one target. The handler can recover an authorized owner checkbox webhook across a same-revision authoritative projection by proving exact target, observation, and context identity; a new head or incompatible projection still fails closed.
  **Post-create admission treats the create response number plus issue-by-number reads as source of truth** (`render_card.verify_unique_open_card` / `_create_and_verify_card`): a valid create must never be closed or labeled `resolved` solely because GitHub's eventually consistent open-list/search index has not yet surfaced the new issue.
  List lag emits structured `wheelhouse card-admission list_index_lag` telemetry and still admits/queues by number; a genuinely observed alternate open card or a malformed direct object fails closed with rollback; an incomplete list probe retains the open card deferred without destructive rollback.
  Destructive admission rollbacks must fail the reconcile pass (`admission rollback(s)` counter) so a scan cannot look healthy after admission loss.
  Covered by `tests/test_card_reuse.py` delayed-index fixtures.
  `render_card.py` writes state markers, but
  `parse_state_block` also accepts the legacy `<!-- triage-state: ... -->`
  marker (cards rendered before the rename) - back-compat that must stay so a live
  queue keeps working. It also tolerates old `wheelhouse-state` cards that lack
  the material fields: a missing field reads as "unknown", so such a card is seen
  as changed exactly once and refreshes itself (backfilling the fields), then
  no-ops. The local lock/board/ledger from the original `triage.py`
  are intentionally dropped (replaced by Actions
  `concurrency` + issues/labels/comments).
  Stale pending-contributor cleanup deliberately stores its state on the TARGET
  PR, not on a Wheelhouse card: the active label is
  `wheelhouse:pending-contributor-action`, the opt-out label is
  `wheelhouse:keep-open`, and hidden JSON markers in target comments carry the
  provable ask/reminder/close records.
- **Workflows:** `ingest` (dispatch/manual -> upsert a card), `decision-handler`
  (tick/slash/**plain-English** -> act on target -> consume resolved cards,
  block non-retryable errors, or leave retryable/non-terminal cards open), `scan-backstop`
  (hourly scan -> deterministic target-side cleanup plus reconcile:
  create/reuse/refresh/activity-reflect/close - the primary keep-current path
  now that cards refresh on material change, render-version staleness, or a
  held-card publish trigger, and can make a hidden state-only activity stamp
  write when live target activity is newer than the card's reflected stamp;
  safe to run hourly because reconcile no-ops unless one of those maintenance
  triggers or an auto-triage cache miss applies, and queues automatic PR or
  issue triage when the
  current revision (a PR's `head_sha`, or an issue's `updatedAt`) lacks a fresh
  `triaged_sha` cache; its "List open cards" step lists THIS repo's open cards via
  `gh api --paginate --slurp "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?..." | jq '...'` -
  `gh api --slurp` and `--jq` are mutually exclusive in the installed `gh` CLI, so
  the `--paginate --slurp` result (an array of per-page arrays) is piped into a
  standalone `jq` instead of passing `--jq` to `gh api` itself;
  `tests/test_workflow_lint.py` guards against this combination reappearing in
  any workflow), `triage` (automatic,
  lightweight, advisory PR-card OR issue-card context; pr-review is gated on
  `auto_triage`, issue-triage on the INDEPENDENT `auto_triage_issues`, both also
  requiring `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`; cache-keyed by source revision), `deep-review` (ALWAYS-ON, code-grounded;
  gated only on `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - no config flag),
  `no-mistakes-required` (PR-to-`main` gate: the job `name:` MUST stay exactly
  `PR must be raised via no-mistakes` - it is the check name the fleet convention
  and this repo's own `wheelhouse.config.yml compliance_check` reference - and it
  passes only when the PR body carries the no-mistakes signature
  `Updates from [git push no-mistakes](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes)`,
  with bot authors skipped; Wheelhouse dogfoods on itself the same gate it enforces
  on the fleet, so contributions go through `git push no-mistakes` - see
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **Scripts:** `wheelhouse_core.py` (scan/classify/dedup/security gate + the
  shared CI-safety verdict `ci_safety` / `repo_pr_target_posture` and scan-time
  auto-approve in `build_repo`, the advisory read-only CI-approval security
  summary `ci_security_summary` (see "CI-approval security summary" in Sharp
  edges), stale pending-contributor cleanup
  (`sweep_pending_contributor_actions`, target-side markers/labels, and legacy-rebase disarming), plus shared utils
  `parse_state_block`, `authorized`, `state`, `nl-decisions-enabled`,
  `auto-triage-enabled`, `auto-triage-issues-enabled`, `qualify_issue_refs`
  (rewrites a bare GitHub-autolink `#N` in model text to `owner/repo#N` - see
  "Cross-repo reference qualification" in Sharp edges)),
  `target_observation.py` (strict revision-bound ReviewObservation v2, concrete persisted-v1 compatibility reader, head-bound approval receipt, and compact projection-reference contracts),
  `decision_context.py` (neutral same-closing-issue, explicit-reference, and exact-shared-path context; a hub path - touched by at least 3 open candidates AND at least half of the open candidate universe - never forms a shared-path relation, so catalog-style README/index files cannot manufacture relations; candidates sort by relation strength - same-closing-issue, then explicit-reference, then exact-shared-path, ties by owner/repo/number - BEFORE the deterministic 10-result display/model cap, so the cap keeps the most informative candidates; the deliberate cap is recorded honestly as `related_candidate_count > len(candidates)` on a still-`complete` context, never as incomplete comparison evidence; `compact_model_context` alone owns title+URL model input), `assessment_admission.py` (typed observation-bound advisory admission; DecisionContext status/content/`context_id` never grant or deny Accept/G6 authority - `context_id` stays in artifacts for provenance/refresh/telemetry only, while `observation_id` and head binding stay exact; `_readmit_context_denied_assessment` in `render_card.py` heals, with zero model spend during the ordinary same-revision refresh, same-head assessments whose persisted admission was denied solely under the retired advisory-context rule), `assessment_record.py` (durable exact-revision agent result), `card_projection.py` (pure complete byte-deterministic PR-review projection), `projection_writer.py` (the sole verified v2 PR-review body/title/managed-label writer), `decision_label_recovery.py` (the narrow authorized, pinned-revision, timeline-proven, durably claimed recovery for a supported decision label erased by that writer), `scheduled_epoch.py` (trusted schedule-only lifecycle epoch),
  `target_reconcile.py` (pure CI-wait observation + receipt -> current/pending/
  unknown projection planner; no GitHub calls or Markdown),
  `render_card.py` (render + card CRUD, including the shared strict closed-card
  lookup/trust/reuse operation used by both ingest and reconcile;
  `CHECKBOX_OPTIONS`/`OPTION_LABELS` carry
  the per-kind checkboxes, including the non-consuming `investigate` box on
  pr-review/issue-triage; held `pending-triage` placeholder rendering;
  automatic triage section rendering, structured recommendation persistence,
  conditional `Accept recommendation` checkbox rendering, `triaged_sha` cache
  updates, automated-status labeling for known harness transcript lines,

  on CI-approval HOLD cards (`_security_review_section`), the non-authoritative
  read-only
  `### Auto-merge criteria` section and trusted history-only workflow hold on
  PR-review cards, plus trusted
  triage-result card edits that publish held cards),
  `apply_decision.py` (deterministic `parse` then
  `execute`; pre-merge workflow-touch gate in `do_merge` that blocks
  `.github/workflows/**` PRs (including renames through `previous_filename`) for
  manual UI merge; non-checkbox actions including
  `comment`, `decline`, and
  pr-review-only `request-changes` with optional cleanup arming after a successful
  GitHub review; the virtual `accept-recommendation` checkbox
  routing into existing deterministic actions; the NON-CONSUMING `investigate`
  routing + `clear-checkbox`; plus the natural-language `nl-eligible`/`nl-prompt`/`nl-route` that map an owner's
  free-text comment to a structured result), `nl_readonly_search.py` (installs
  the optional `wheelhouse-search` wrapper for READONLY_TOKEN-backed LLM
  context),
  `automerge_criteria.py` (stable criterion IDs/labels and fail-closed
  normalization shared by evaluator and renderer), `auto_merge.py`

  `build_item.py` (normalize ingest payload), `reconcile.py` (backstop
  create/**refresh**/activity-reflect/close/reuse, durable result-to-projection retry, and automatic triage dispatch). The complete Option B production, compatibility, observability, migration, and rollback contract is `docs/OPTION_B_CARD_PROJECTION.md`. `apply_decision` imports `wheelhouse_core` and
  `nl_readonly_search`; `reconcile`/`render_card` import `wheelhouse_core` (and
  `build_item` imports `render_card`) via
  `sys.path.insert(0, dirname(__file__))`.
- **Reusable actions (pinned to full SHAs).** `decision-handler` delegates two
  mechanical jobs to the `issue-ops` toolkit instead of hand-rolling them:
  `issue-ops/parser` renders the card's checkboxes as `{selected, unselected}`
  (run twice - new body + pre-edit body - so `apply_decision.py` can keep the
  "exactly one newly-ticked" diff), and `issue-ops/labeler` does every
  `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked`/`needs-decision` add/remove (with
  `create: true` so it also creates the label objects). Pin both to a commit SHA
  with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment; never a floating tag.

## Sharp edges

- **`check_status()` aggregates by equivalent check identity, never scalar
  last-write-wins - cards #392 and #1537.**
  GitHub's GraphQL `statusCheckRollup.contexts` can return more than one
  check-run with the SAME name (e.g. `concurrency: cancel-in-progress`
  leaving CANCELLED siblings beside a completed SUCCESS on the same head).
  `check_status()` (`scripts/wheelhouse_core.py`) groups by exact check name
  on the current head and reduces each group: substantive
  FAILURE/TIMED_OUT/ACTION_REQUIRED/STARTUP_FAILURE -> `"fail"`; any
  non-completed -> `"pending"`; a completed SUCCESS makes same-name
  CANCELLED siblings ignorable -> `"pass"`; cancelled-only evidence is
  never pass. Across different names (e.g. matrix legs) results still
  worst-wins. A scalar last-write-wins assignment inside the loop (card
  #392) would make the result depend on GraphQL array order instead of
  policy. As a fail-toward-safe backstop, `check_status()` also clamps
  `compliance` to `"fail"` whenever GitHub's own authoritative
  `statusCheckRollup.state` is `"FAILURE"`/`"ERROR"` and the per-context read
  would otherwise say `"pass"`/`"n/a"`, except when every non-pass rollup
  context is an ignorable CANCELLED sibling of a proven same-name SUCCESS
  (card #1537 concurrency poison). Untracked/optional failures still fail
  closed. Repositories whose compliance check depends on mutable PR-body events
  may explicitly opt into `wheelhouse.actions-current-body/v1`; the producer,
  bounded Actions API reads, exact workflow/run/CheckRun bindings, latest
  `run_number` semantics, and fail-closed freshness rules are authoritative in
  `docs/CURRENT_BODY_COMPLIANCE.md` and covered by
  `tests/test_compliance_event_evidence.py`. Non-opted-in reduction is unchanged.
  See `tests/test_check_status.py`.
- **Failed decision = durable open `blocked`, never pure `needs-decision`
  (card #447), except recoverable merge conflicts.** `decision-handler.yml`
  maps `terminal_state == 'error'` onto the same label path as `blocked` (add
  `blocked`, drop `needs-decision`; do NOT close). Leaving a failed action as
  pure `needs-decision` lets reconcile's soft self-heal silently consume it as
  `resolved` when the open target later leaves the worklist. Hard-close still
  auto-cleans a `blocked` card once the target is genuinely merged/closed.
  **Exception (card #1544):** `do_merge` returns terminal `none` when GitHub
  reports a merge conflict (still posts the conflict note). Terminal `none`
  does not add `blocked` or drop `needs-decision`, so the card stays pure
  pending and the existing scan/reconcile refresh path reactivates it after a
  clean new head. Generic non-conflict failures stay durable `error`/`blocked`.
  Stale-head rechecks and NL revision binding are unchanged. Guarded by the
  YAML-inspection in `tests/test_nl_decisions_search.py`
  (`test_error_terminal_state_labels_as_blocked`, plus `none`/retryable
  keep-actionable checks), the soft/hard-close cases in `tests/test_reconcile.py`,
  and `tests/test_decision.py`
  (`test_merge_conflict_is_recoverable_not_durable_blocked`).
- **Workflow-touching PRs are manual UI merges by design (Option B; cards
  #442/#447).** `FLEET_TOKEN` intentionally has no Workflows write. Before any
  card-driven `do_merge` API call, `apply_decision._workflow_merge_block`
  inspects the PR's net file list **and** each commit in its history for
  `.github/workflows/**` paths, including a rename's `previous_filename`
  (`wheelhouse_core._workflow_merge_gated_files` -
  narrower than `_risky_ci_files`; composite `action.yml` is Contents-gated and
  not blocked here). On a hit or an unable-to-verify read, merge is skipped and
  the card lands terminal `blocked` (durable open `blocked` label, not pure
  `needs-decision`) with owner-facing manual-UI-merge guidance (includes the PR
  URL). That protects against soft-heal false-close and keeps the card out of
  auto-merge V1 claiming without changing V1 gates. Hard-close still auto-cleans
  once the target is genuinely merged/closed. Detection is re-run on every later
  `/merge` once the card is actionable again, so a rebase that drops workflow
  touches can proceed. Auto-merge V1 exclusions, the pwn-request HOLD, and token
  scopes are unchanged. Covered by `tests/test_decision.py` workflow-merge-gate
  cases.
- Decision cards are machine-created.
  The target author is shown as plain text (`by <login>`), never as a GitHub
  `@mention`.
  Cards are the owner's private queue and must not notify contributors.
  The card body's hidden state block and the
  per-checkbox `<!-- opt:KEY -->` markers are load-bearing - the handler diffs
  the `selected` lists `issue-ops/parser` returns for the new vs pre-edit body to
  find the newly-ticked option (the marker survives because the parser strips
  only the `- [x] ` prefix), and parses slash-commands against the kind's allowed
  set. Don't reformat them away.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/wheelhouse-decision.yml` is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
  `issue-ops/parser` only returns `{selected, unselected}` when a template marks
  the section as a `checkboxes` field, and it matches the section by EXACT heading
  text. Its `checkboxes` label MUST stay `"Your decision"` to match the
  `### Your decision` heading `render_card.py` emits. (Cards are still rendered by
  `render_card.py`, not this template; a hand-filed issue from it has no state
  block, so the handler treats it as a no-op.)
- **Card refresh (an open card must reflect CURRENT target state).** Both the
  event path (`render_card.upsert_card`) and the backstop (`reconcile.py`) keep a
  card current: when a target's MATERIAL state changes - `head_sha`, bucket,
  compliance (`comp`), tests (`tests`), projection freshness/head/completeness,
  `kind`, `priority`, or checkbox `options` - the card is re-rendered in place.
  Observation ID/time are persisted in `projection_ref` but intentionally do not
  trigger churn when every semantic dimension is unchanged. Exact deterministic card-title drift is also a
  trigger for every kind, using the renderer's same 70-character truncation,
  while summary/recommendation remain non-triggers. A valid strictly newer
  issue-triage `updated_at` is a full-refresh trigger when the advisory queued
  write does not already own that revision advance. Option comparisons use set equality; display
  order remains the order provided in the card body/state. A refresh ALSO fires
  when the card's stored `render_version` is behind the current
  `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` - a non-material, one-time, self-terminating trigger
  (`render_stale`) for propagating a display-only fix (e.g. the author
  `@mention` drop) to already-open cards that have no material trigger of their
  own. A card missing `render_version` (written before this field existed)
  reads as behind, so every pre-existing pure card refreshes exactly once and
  then carries the current version (`render()` stamps it), so it no-ops on the
  next scan - no churn loop. Bump `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` whenever a future
  display-only change should propagate the same way. A render-version-only
  refresh is a same-revision cosmetic refresh (same `head_sha` for a pr-review
  card, same `updated_at` for an issue-triage card): it reuses the same
  `_preserve_same_revision_triage` path as a same-revision refresh (an
  existing `### Triage` section and its `triaged_sha`/`triage_status` cache
  survive untouched, no re-triage for that revision), and it does NOT drop the
  "target updated" comment (that stays gated strictly on `head_sha` actually
  changing - an issue's `updated_at` alone never triggers that comment, since
  it is not a material field). `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` is currently `17`: the
  16 -> 17 bump publishes mergeability-independent captain readiness and the
  inert, source-bound maintainer-edits policy card. The 15 -> 16 bump presents
  machine `INELIGIBLE` as `MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED` without changing persisted
  state or G0-G7 semantics. The 14 -> 15 bump
  makes a current admitted assessment the sole owner-facing
  current triage outcome - historical primary-failed / advisory-consumption
  telemetry stays in non-material state for diagnostics, but the visible
  "consumed for advisory triage" warning is suppressed whenever production
  authority predicates already grant a current admitted assessment / Accept
  surface (cards #1735 class); true no-authority stuck-advisory cards keep the
  explicit unavailable warnings (card #1759 class). The owning helpers are
  `render_card.triage_section(current_authority=...)`,
  `current_triage_authority_present`, `body_with_coherent_advisory_telemetry`,
  and the read-only `contradictory_advisory_telemetry_census`; the 13 -> 14 bump
  makes recommendation framing controls-aware so a projection that suppresses
  decision checkboxes (confirming/inert lifecycle or held placeholder) never
  keeps the "Tick **Accept recommendation**" instruction that references an
  absent Accept control - analysis and the explicit inert decision copy stay;
  the ordinary published card keeps the actionable framing and checkbox
  (card #1721 / scan-5). The owning helpers for that bump are
  `render_card._recommendation_section(controls_available=...)`,
  `body_with_reconcile_absence`, and the read-only
  `contradictory_accept_instruction_census`; the 12 -> 13 bump qualifies bare
  target-derived references in the deterministic title quote and warning
  surfaces using the existing `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs` helper,
  while leaving Wheelhouse-owned self-references such as G1 `card #N` evidence
  bare; the 11 -> 12 bump
  establishes ONE canonical recommendation surface - it drops the
  deterministic check-derived `### Recommended action` copy, drops the cached
  `Recommended next step` bullet from an existing `### Triage` block, and folds
  a legacy admission warning back inside the triage markers so it survives the
  lift; the
  10 -> 11 bump republishes DecisionContext-neutral related-work copy and runs
  the zero-spend re-admission of assessments denied solely under the retired
  advisory-context admission rule; the
  9 -> 10 bump publishes truthful incomplete-context authority copy; the 8 -> 9 bump publishes deterministic triage-suppression reasons and makes G6 credential wording distinct from card triage eligibility; the 7 -> 8 bump groups auto-merge criteria by gate family and separates G6's complete-diff behavior facts from its VISION.md-dependent subtree;
  6 -> 7 bump publishes the non-authoritative read-only `### Auto-merge criteria`
  section on already-open PR-review cards; the 5 -> 6 bump publishes the
  advisory read-only `### Security review` section on
  already-open CI-approval HOLD cards (display-only; the pwn-request hold and
  manual approve are unchanged); the
  4 -> 5 bump labels known claude-code-action harness polling/status transcript
  lines in card-visible auto-triage output and older cached `### Triage`
  sections without stripping content; the 3 -> 4 bump publishes the
  conditional `Accept recommendation` checkbox (its companion deterministic
  recommendation was later removed entirely by the 11 -> 12 bump); the
  2 -> 3 bump publishes the
  `/request-changes <text>` PR-review slash hint on already-open cards; the
  earlier 1 -> 2 bump retroactively re-qualifies cross-repo refs cached in an
  already-open card's `### Triage` section from before `qualify_issue_refs`
  existed.
  `_preserve_same_revision_triage` now runs the lifted section
  through `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs(section, owner, repo)` before
  re-inserting it - `owner` is `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` (read in
  `_refresh_card`, the same env source the fresh-triage render path uses) and
  `repo` is the card's own deterministic `old_state["repo"]` (falling back to
  the item's repo), NEVER the model's own text. The renderer also applies this
  same helper only to the target-derived title quote and warning line; it must
  never qualify the whole card body because Wheelhouse-owned G1 `card #N`
  evidence is intentionally a self-reference. This is the same one-time,
  self-terminating propagation shape as the earlier author `@mention` drop:
  every pre-existing card refreshes once, gets its cached triage refs
  qualified, known automated status lines labeled, and its `render_version`
  stamped with the current version, and the next scan is a full no-op unless
  target activity later advances past the reflected stamp.
  The `TRIAGE_START`/`### Triage`/`TRIAGE_END` markers contain no
  `#N` and do not match the automated-status allowlist, so repairing the whole
  section string leaves them intact.
  Target-activity sorting is deliberately not a full refresh. If a pure pending
  card's live target `updated_at` is strictly newer than its stored
  `activity_reflected_at`, `reflect_activity` may replace only the hidden state
  block so the card issue's own GitHub `updatedAt` moves for
  `sort:updated-desc`. It never re-renders visible card UI, changes labels,
  comments, or touches the target repo. A full refresh and the auto-triage
  queued-cache write both stamp `activity_reflected_at` as part of their
  existing body edit, so they do not do a second activity-only write. For a
  legacy card with no stamp, the card issue's own `updatedAt` is the baseline,
  which avoids one-time churn across an old queue.
  The shared pure helpers live in `render_card.py`
  (`material_changed`, `render_stale`, `held_publish_needed`, `refresh_needed`,
  `activity_reflection_needed`, `is_refreshable`, `plan_label_update`);
  `reconcile.py`
  pre-checks them (using the card row it already listed) so the common
  no-change and activity-fresh case never hits the API, and `upsert_card`
  re-checks them before it edits (defense in depth for the event path). Four
  rules are load-bearing and must not be loosened:
  - **Only refresh a pure `needs-decision` card.** A re-render resets the card's
    checkboxes, so a card already `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked` is left
    completely untouched - refreshing one would clobber an in-flight decision or
    race the decision-handler. (`is_refreshable` is the guard; the lock set is
    `NON_REFRESHABLE_LABELS`.) This is the chosen safe rule, and it gates the
    `render_version` trigger exactly the same way - a mid-decision card is
    never refreshed just because it is render-stale.
    A held `pending-triage` card deliberately stays refreshable because it keeps
    `needs-decision` and carries no non-refreshable lock label.
  - **Keep activity reflection state-only.** A card that is materially unchanged,
    render-fresh, and does not need held-state publishing may still get one
    hidden `activity_reflected_at` edit when target activity advanced. That edit
    is card-only under the default token, with no target write, no label churn,
    no comment, and no full re-render. If target activity is not newer either,
    the card gets no body edit - never rewrite a card just to put back an
    identical body. The
    material check is a cheap dict compare of the state block's material
    fields, which is why those fields are carried in the state JSON; the
    render-staleness check is the same kind of cheap compare against
    `render_version`, and `held_publish_needed` is the same kind of cheap
    predicate for a held card whose auto-triage path is no longer available.
    The activity check is a cheap timestamp compare against
    `activity_reflected_at` or, for legacy cards, the card issue's own
    `updatedAt`.
  - **Replace the managed labels, don't just add.** `upsert_card` removes
    `repo:*`/`kind:*`/`priority:*`/`target:*` labels that no longer apply
    (`plan_label_update`), so a changed priority/kind doesn't leave both the old
    and new label stuck on the card. It also syncs the exact `pending-triage`
    label to the current `held` state. `needs-decision` and any human-added
    label are never removed.
  When `head_sha` changed the refresh also drops a short "target updated" card
  comment so the owner sees a re-review is warranted rather than being silently
  swapped underneath. All card writes described here, including target-activity
  reflection, stay on the ambient `GH_TOKEN` (= default `GITHUB_TOKEN`) like
  every other card write, so they never re-trigger the handler and never run
  under `FLEET_TOKEN`. reconcile only ever refreshes or reflects from scanned
  `items`, which exist solely for `ok:true` repos, so an `ok:false` repo (state
  unknown) is never refreshed or activity-stamped - the same invariant that bars
  closing its cards.
- **Automatic triage is a cached card-side side job, not routing - and now
  covers issue-triage as well as pr-review, on two INDEPENDENT toggles.**
  It applies only to pure `needs-decision` cards (including held
  `pending-triage` cards, which deliberately retain `needs-decision`), gated
  per kind: pr-review by the effective `auto_triage` setting, issue-triage by
  the effective `auto_triage_issues` setting - each with its own global default
  (both TRUE), per-repo override, and item-level opt-out, so flipping one never changes the
  other's behavior. Both also require `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to be present.
  For explicit ingest payloads, `auto_triage:false` / `auto_triage_issues:false`
  are item-level opt-outs only; neither can force triage on when the global or
  per-repo config disables it.
  The cache key is the card state's `triaged_sha`, compared to the item's
  current **revision** - a pr-review item's `head_sha`, or an issue-triage
  item's `updated_at` (issues have no head SHA, so their GraphQL `updatedAt`
  is the freshness key instead; it advances on any edit or new comment).
  `render_card.triage_revision(item)` / `render_card.state_revision(state,
  kind)` are the single pair of helpers that pick the right field for a kind;
  every triage cache function (`triage_fresh`, `should_auto_triage`,
  `body_with_triage_queued`, `body_with_triage_result`,
  `_preserve_same_revision_triage`) goes through them so pr-review and
  issue-triage share one code path instead of forking it.
  Missing `triaged_sha` on an existing open card counts as stale, so legacy
  cards of either kind backfill exactly once on the next eligible scan.
  Before dispatching `triage.yml`, `reconcile.py` / the ingest fast path edits
  the card state to set `triaged_sha=<current revision>` and
  `triage_status=queued` so an asynchronous error, timeout, or parse failure cannot trigger an hourly retry loop; every sanctioned later cache clear remains bounded by `triage_attempts` and the daily ledger.
  **A just-created card must be read back BY NUMBER, never via
  `find_card`'s label-filtered `gh issue list`.** That listing is not
  read-after-write consistent immediately after `gh issue create`, so reading
  it back milliseconds later can silently miss the card and skip queuing its
  first auto-triage attempt (only a later scan's pre-existing-card backfill
  path would then catch it). The same eventual-consistency gap used to drive
  destructive post-create rollback when uniqueness polled only the open-list
  index; admission now verifies the direct issue first (see state-block
  uniqueness note above) and only uses the list to detect alternate open cards.
  `_create_card`/`upsert_card` therefore always
  return an int issue number (never a URL), and `reconcile.py`'s new-card
  branch reads the fresh card via `current_card({"number": n})` -> `get_card`,
  which IS consistent. The ingest fast path mirrors this: the `upsert` CLI
  writes the created/refreshed number to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (`issue=N`), and
  `ingest.yml`'s "Queue auto triage" step passes it as `queue-triage --issue
  N`, so that path also reads by number; `queue-triage` keeps the `find_card`
  lookup only as a fallback when no number is supplied (back-compat for a
  manual invocation).
  `triaged_sha`, `triage_recommendation`, `updated_at`, and the visible
  `### Triage` section are non-material: they must never affect `classify`,
  `material_changed`, fork-CI approval, author filtering, or conflict routing.
  For a pr-review card, `head_sha` IS material, so a head move both refreshes
  the card and makes the fresh head eligible for a spend-guarded triage attempt
  in the same pass. For an issue-triage card, `updated_at` is NOT material (an issue's
  title/comp/tests/kind/priority/options rarely change on a new comment), so a
  new comment/edit can make the card eligible for a spend-guarded triage attempt.
  When eligible, the existing single queued write owns the revision advance;
  when ineligible, the strictly newer timestamp triggers one deterministic full
  refresh without reserving budget or dispatching an advisory.
  If config is off or the token is absent, no dispatch happens and cards render
  exactly as the deterministic card did before this feature.
  `triage.yml` itself checks out the PR head for a pr-review card (and
  verifies it did not move), or the repo's DEFAULT branch read-only for an
  issue-triage card (there is no head to verify); both paths share the same
  gate/Claude/card-update steps, security posture, and `--revision` CLI
  argument (`render_card.py triage-apply|triage-fail --revision <head_sha or
  updated_at>`).
- **Automatic-triage spend guards are enforced inside the shared queued checkpoint.**
  `render_card.mark_triage_queued` reserves from the one trusted closed UTC daily ledger before it writes the non-material, versioned `triage_attempts` count and existing queued cache together, verifies the card by number, and returns the sole permit accepted by `dispatch_triage_workflow`.
  `triage_attempt_cap_per_revision` defaults to 2 queued attempts, accepts integers 1 through 5, may be overridden per repository, and fails closed to 1 when invalid.
  The global-only `triage_daily_ceiling` defaults to 1200 reservations per UTC day, accepts integers 1 through 2000, and fails closed to 0 when invalid; one reservation authorizes one triage run whose bounded schema repair permits at most two model calls.
  The finite default keeps approved operator replay paced by reviewable waves rather than cost, while preserving a hard runaway-containment bound.
  Malformed, ambiguous, untrusted, duplicate, unreadable, or unverified ledger state denies reservations, and a crash or verification failure may leak capacity only in the safe direction.
  All current automatic queue writers are serialized by the `wheelhouse-backstop` concurrency group, while deep-review and natural-language decision runs remain outside this ceiling because they require deliberate owner actions and durable claims.
  A pr-review re-triage whose ONLY trigger is a verified base-SHA or VISION-SHA movement against an unchanged, already-attempted head (audit F13; G6 binds those SHAs) consumes the SEPARATE `triage_context_refresh_allowance` instead of the ordinary cap: default 2, integers 0 through 5 (0 disables), per-repo override, invalid fails closed to 0.
  Each use binds the exact (head, base, VISION) identity in the non-material versioned `triage_context_allowance` state record, so a repeated identity grants nothing and a malformed record denies; verified means the card carries a complete recorded prior identity - legacy cards and first-time VISION appearance stay on the ordinary budget.
  Ordinary same-context failure retries (including operator replay, which clears the cache) stay on `triage_attempt_cap_per_revision`; every context refresh still reserves one daily-ceiling unit and returns the same sealed permit; an exhausted, repeated, or untrusted allowance emits the explicit bounded `context.deferred` diagnostic with no dispatch; and `body_with_triage_queued` no-ops on a fresh identical identity so a raced duplicate call cannot buy spend from either budget.
  The authoritative implementation and offline failure matrix are `scripts/render_card.py`, `scripts/wheelhouse_core.py`, `tests/test_triage_budget.py`, and `tests/test_triage_context_allowance.py`.
- **Automatic-triage replay is operator-only, exact-revision, and admission-safe.**
  `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the workflow-level operator invocation, exact-selector replay-only isolation, fail-closed validation, claim tombstone, duplicate-only evidence, and exact-revision admission-denial contracts.
  PR-triage durable claims bind the queued, complete ReviewObservation ID plus base and default-branch VISION SHA-or-absence through an opaque context token; the queue permit is the only dispatch source, and `triage.yml` re-reads the queued card plus live head/base/VISION before reconstructing it. Same-context delivery remains deduplicated before spend while first-VISION, verified base/VISION, and complete-observation changes get distinct events. Issue-triage identity is unchanged.
  A checked-in `triage_replay.BACKFILL_POLICIES` entry can grant one separate, versioned policy-backfill allowance only to an exact owner-selected cohort. It never resets ordinary attempts, is replay-only with two exact-read preflights, tombstones only the matching primary claim, and retains card-1585/other incident-marker refusals. See `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.
  Legacy candidate listings supply issue numbers only; an optional exact-card selector bypasses that discovery step, while every selected card and live target is still re-read by exact number before a marker write.
  Replay normally clears only a proven current `triage_status:error` non-success cache, marks an entirely absent cache, or re-enters the bounded duplicate-only cohort whose prior replay was denied before task construction; `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the narrow exact-selector-only advisory-cache exception.
  `triage_replay._advisory_recovery_refusal` is the single code owner of that exception's proof, and the workflow deliberately restates no predicate.
  The distinct observation-drift targeted-refresh class proven by cards #1584/#1819 is shared by ordinary maintenance and the exact-selector fallback; `render_card.observation_drift_refresh_refusal` is the single code owner of its proof, and `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the detailed automatic and operator contracts.
  The exact-selector fallback writes the versioned non-material `triage_replay` marker and re-enters `reconcile.maybe_queue_auto_triage`; ordinary maintenance enters the same reservation, queued checkpoint, sealed dispatch permit, and `triage.yml` admission without a replay marker.
  Malformed or mismatched state, markers, identities, revisions, labels, authorship, sources, attempt counts, or budget ledgers fail closed.
  `--dry-run` performs the same exact-number eligibility reads and reports planned actions without any GitHub write.
  The evidence-empty E7 and array-recovery G1 recoveries have separate incident-scoped attempts-reset cohorts in `scripts/triage_replay.py`.
  Each reset is admitted only for its dedicated sanctioned wave plus the explicitly supplied complete code-defined cohort.
  Every card is bound to its exact diagnosed revision and prior replay marker before its trusted count of 2 is reset to 1 for the queued write.
  A full cohort second-read preflight refuses any mismatch before a reset write, and a one-use v2 marker excludes completed members from ordinary replay while allowing only the same sanctioned cohort's pending members to resume.
  Each reset refuses policy drift away from cap 2 and leaves both the global per-revision cap and daily ceiling unchanged.
  `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the additive `wheelhouse-triage-record` migration record shape.
- **One canonical recommendation surface (card #1746).** A card presents a
  recommendation ONLY when it comes from a current ADMITTED structured
  agent-triage result, and only in `### Recommended action`
  (`render_card._recommendation_section`, gated by
  `accept_recommendation_available`). There is deliberately NO deterministic
  check-derived recommendation: `wheelhouse_core._recommendation`,
  `target_reconcile._TERMINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS`, the item `recommendation` field,
  and the `ingest` `recommendation` input are all gone. Compliance, test, and
  mergeability facts stay facts in `### Situation` and the auto-merge criteria -
  never owner guidance to act. `### Triage` carries analysis only (summary,
  product implications, and the honest primary-failure/admission warnings); the
  model's advisory action is NOT rendered there, so a delivered-but-invalid or
  non-admitted candidate can never show "merge" as the agent's recommendation
  beside a G6 row that truthfully says none was established. That G6 evidence
  reads "no valid agent recommendation was established: the advisory assessment
  was not admitted" - it never implies the model recommended something else, and
  the row stays UNMET with identical authority semantics. Existing cards heal
  through the ordinary `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 11 -> 12 migration
  (`_without_legacy_recommended_next_step` plus `_with_lifted_admission_warning`
  in `_preserve_same_revision_triage`): zero model spend, no target write, and
  no change to admission, cache freshness, options, or gates. The admission
  warning is written INSIDE the triage markers so the same-revision lift keeps
  it. The projection path (an admitted assessment re-renders `### Triage` from
  the bound artifact rather than lifting the cached section) explicitly carries
  the prior same-revision card's NON-MATERIAL
  `triage_primary_status`/`triage_primary_error_code`/`triage_consumption`, so a
  refresh cannot delete the honest primary-failure record.
  `render_card.legacy_recommendation_presentation` /
  `recommendation_census` (and the read-only
  `render_card.py recommendation-census <cards.json>` CLI, which takes the same
  open-card list `reconcile.py` consumes and performs NO GitHub call or write)
  are the census and post-backfill verification helpers: they classify the
  complete list into affected / clean / skipped-with-reason. Deliberately NOT
  auto-corrected, and reported instead: cards carrying
  `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked` (re-rendering would clobber an in-flight or
  consumed decision), and cards frozen by an `ok:false`/`truncated`/
  `indeterminate`/CI-wait scan - each heals on the first scan where it is a
  pure refreshable `needs-decision` card again. Covered by
  `tests/test_canonical_recommendation.py`.
- **Incomplete observations never weaken PR-review projection ownership.**
  The only presentation-only exception is the bounded, operator-selected
  deletions path documented in `docs/OPTION_B_CARD_PROJECTION.md` and guarded by
  `tests/test_presentation_migration.py`. Its separate stale-affordance mode
  may remove only the exact Accept recommendation checkbox when the shipped
  `accept_recommendation_available` gate is false; it preserves the hidden state
  and render version and is never a scheduled queue-wide writer.
- **Accept recommendation is a deterministic shortcut, not model action.** A
  successful current auto-triage attempt for pr-review or issue-triage may
  prepend an `Accept recommendation` checkbox when the structured
  `triage_recommendation` state is fresh (`triaged_sha` equals the current
  revision) and its normalized action is in `ACCEPT_ALLOWED_BY_KIND`.
  It is never rendered for `ci-approval`, never maps to `approve-ci`, and legacy
  `recommended_next_step` Markdown is deliberately not parsed into an accept
  action.
  Actions that post text (`close`, `decline`, `comment`, `request-changes`)
  require a non-empty `recommended_reason`; missing, stale, failed, invalid,
  non-allowlisted, and non-structured recommendations no-op at parse time.
  Ticking the box maps to the existing deterministic executor action and
  `free_text`, preserving head-SHA rechecks and token boundaries; if the
  recommendation is `investigate`, it stays non-consuming and clears the clicked
  accept box.
  Bare `#N` refs in `recommended_reason` are qualified against the card state's
  target repo before the reason can be posted, used as a decline/close note, or
  submitted as a request-changes review.
- **Held cards - a card is not owner-visible in its normal form until its
  first auto-triage attempt completes.** When `should_hold` says a brand-new
  pr-review/issue-triage card would have triage queued for it (same gate as
  auto triage itself: the per-kind flag AND `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), the
  card is created HELD instead of in its normal form: `needs-decision` STAYS
  (triage.yml's resolve step requires a pure, refreshable `needs-decision`
  card or it never runs), the `pending-triage` label (`HOLD_LABEL`) is added
  on top, and the body's "Your decision" section is a placeholder with no
  checkboxes - no `<!-- opt:* -->` markers, so it is naturally inert to the
  decision handler's checkbox/slash-command parsing; `apply_decision.py
  cmd_parse`/`cmd_nl_eligible` also short-circuit on the state block's
  `held` flag as defense in depth. `held` is a non-material state key (like
  `triaged_sha`) - never in `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, never affecting
  classify/material_changed/decision-parsing/target-execution/
  fork-CI-safety/author-filtering/conflict-routing.
  A held card is **published** - real checkboxes appear, `pending-triage` is
  removed - the moment its own auto-triage ATTEMPT completes, in the SAME
  `update_card_triage` call `triage-apply`/`triage-fail` already use: this is
  gated on the attempt COMPLETING, never on it SUCCEEDING, so a held card can
  never stay hidden because triage errored, timed out, or (a fail-open
  hardening beyond the original ask) even failed to DISPATCH -
  `reconcile.py`'s `maybe_queue_auto_triage` and the `queue-triage` CLI both
  now publish a held card immediately with a "could not be started" note if
  `dispatch_triage_workflow` itself throws, since the queued-cache write
  already landed and a later scan would never retry that revision otherwise.
  Publishing is keyed to the card's own CURRENT revision
  (`state_revision`/`triage_revision`): a stale attempt whose revision no
  longer matches (the card was refreshed to a newer revision while the
  attempt was in flight) is a no-op, because that refresh already queued a
  fresh attempt for the new revision which will publish the card itself -
  exactly mirroring how a stale triage result is already dropped for a
  published card.
  A refresh rechecks a currently held card with the same `should_hold(item, has_token)` gate used at creation.
  If the refreshed item still qualifies for auto triage, `upsert_card` preserves the placeholder and queues the fresh attempt as before.
  If the refreshed item no longer qualifies (for example the kind changed away from pr-review/issue-triage, config disabled auto triage, or the token is absent), `upsert_card` publishes it silently in that same refresh pass: normal checkboxes, no `pending-triage` label, no `held` state key, and no synthetic triage section or note.
  This keeps a held card's self-heal-close (its target left the worklist, or merged/closed) working through the SAME existing reconcile logic with no held-specific branching, since a held card is `is_refreshable` exactly like any other pure pending card.
  Config off or no token: a brand-new eligible card is created in its normal form immediately, exactly as before this feature - never held.
  **Fail-open safety net for a `triage.yml` run that never reaches its
  update step at all** (e.g. `resolve` itself throws on a transient `gh
  issue view` error before writing its outputs, which would otherwise leave
  the update step running with an EMPTY issue/revision and silently doing
  nothing - `triaged_sha` is already cached for that revision, so no future
  scan would ever retry it and the card would stay held forever): a final
  `always()` step runs `render_card.py triage-recover --issue --kind
  --revision`, sourced from the RAW `workflow_dispatch` inputs (never
  `steps.resolve.outputs`, which may be empty). It grounds against the
  card's actual CURRENT state and is a no-op unless the card is genuinely
  still held with `triage_status: queued` for exactly that revision -
  publishing it with a generic "did not finish" note only in that exact
  stuck case, so it can never double-write over a result the normal update
  step already recorded, whether that result was a success or a `triage-fail`.
  If the trusted source snapshot is unavailable, the workflow cannot safely run
  `render_card.py`; in that narrow case it clears the queued triage cache for
  the exact raw-input revision instead, so a future scan can retry rather than
  leaving the held card permanently hidden. This no-trusted-source security
  fallback covers both issue-triage and PR-review cards, stays exempt from full
  auto-merge re-evaluation because trusted code is unavailable, and visibly
  warns on the card that the checklist may temporarily reflect the prior queued
  state until trusted card maintenance resumes.
- **Context-equivalent single correction turn - one automatic retry for any
  delivered triage candidate that fails trusted validation, never for the
  excluded classes.** A delivered candidate failing the complete bound action
  schema, the UTF-8 evidence-quote byte policy, or trusted evidence anchoring
  gets exactly one correction; missing results and infrastructure failures do
  not. The correction rebuilds the original AgentTask from its verified
  handoff, preserves its action, model, tools, search, network boundaries,
  immutable inputs, schema binding, and limits, and must pass the same complete
  trusted validation before it has authority. A failed correction can leave
  an advisory-consumable primary only as explicitly advisory-only: no
  admission, Accept shortcut, persisted recommendation, or auto-merge verdict.
  `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the detailed eligibility, exact-binding,
  correction-task, evidence-byte, anchoring, outcome, and rollback contract.
  There is at most one correction per admitted triage dispatch; any separately
  sanctioned later dispatch consumes another per-revision attempt and daily
  reservation.
  Telemetry lives in NON-MATERIAL state keys
  `triage_repair_status` (`repaired` | `repair-failed`; absent = never attempted),
  `triage_repair_reason` (the structural failure), and `triage_repair_candidate`
  (a redacted, content-free candidate shape from `redacted_candidate_shape` -
  only allowlisted schema-field membership + an unknown-key COUNT, never a
  model-chosen key name or value) - like `triaged_sha`, never in
  `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, never affecting classify/material_changed/decision-parsing.
  The persisted diagnostics carry only structural facts, never raw target/comment
  content. The legacy no-tool repair branch remains as disabled Codex evidence
  and a deployable rollback surface; the production Claude lane never builds a
  `triage.schema-repair` task. See `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` and
  `tests/test_triage_schema_repair.py`.
- Natural-language decisions accept only owner/maintainer comments and are structured.
  `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the native structured-output and bounded schema-repair contract.
  `apply_decision.py nl-route` is the trust boundary - it validates `action` against the per-kind allowlist and only then
  sets the `decision` output that makes the SAME deterministic `execute` run
  (so every guard - allowlist, head-SHA re-check, fork-CI HOLD, token isolation,
  concurrency - applies unchanged). `answer`/`clarify` only post a card comment
  and leave the card open.
  The advisory `### Triage` section and hidden `triage_recommendation` state are
  removed from the trusted card context before the NL prompt is built, so a prior
  model recommendation cannot become an instruction to the intent-mapper.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is absent, the LLM receives
  `Read,Grep,Glob` and no GitHub credential. When the
  optional `READONLY_TOKEN` secret is present, the LLM step uses that read-only
  public-scoped token as both the action `github_token` input and shell
  `GH_TOKEN`, plus a narrow Bash allow-list for `wheelhouse-search`, which wraps
  scoped read-only `gh` lookups across the target repo and configured fleet
  repos.
  The pinned action's subprocess isolation removes the trusted job's default
  GitHub token before model execution, so only the explicitly selected
  read-only search credential can cross that boundary.
  Search output is UNTRUSTED DATA for answering questions only, never an
  instruction and never an authorization to act.
  The LLM never receives `FLEET_TOKEN` - it maps intent or answers, it never acts.
  After Claude runs, trusted code admits an `AgentResult` only through the
  documented result-validation boundary; `nl-route` and `execute` consume only that
  normalized result from a read-only trusted source copy with a scrubbed
  environment.
  An eligible primary-result failure can claim only one same-comment `nl-decision.schema-repair` task; it is tokenless, one-turn/no-tool, and strictly revalidated before any reply or action.
  A duplicate or still-invalid repair leaves the card open with a content-free, retryable failure note.
  `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the detailed runtime contract.
- Token discipline per step: scan/execute and the read-only target reads for the
  LLM (`triage` prepare + target-code checkout, `deep-review` prepare + its target-code checkout, decision-handler
  `nl-fetch`) use `FLEET_TOKEN`; all
  card writes - including every `issue-ops/labeler` step (its `github_token`
  defaults to `github.token`, passed explicitly here) - use `github.token`. The
  card's own comment thread is also this repo's data, so the NL `nl-comments`
  fetch uses `github.token`, NOT `FLEET_TOKEN`. Mixing them either breaks
  cross-repo acting or creates a re-trigger loop. The LLM step itself never gets
  `FLEET_TOKEN`; without `READONLY_TOKEN` it receives no shell credential or
  shell tools, and with `READONLY_TOKEN` it only gets that read credential as the
  action `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN` for context search through
  `wheelhouse-search`. Target content reaches every LLM path only as delimited
  untrusted data in bounded files, while search output reaches the LLM only as
  delimited untrusted prompt data. Triage/deep-review code is already on disk from a
  `persist-credentials: false` checkout, so NO acting token is left on disk for
  the LLM to read.
  `READONLY_TOKEN` is never used by `execute`, never used by stale
  pending-contributor cleanup, and never gates or authorizes an action.
- **Investigate is a NON-CONSUMING checkbox (the one tick that doesn't close the
  card).** It is offered on pr-review/issue-triage cards (NOT ci-approval, a fast
  security gate). Ticking it must NEVER consume the card: `apply_decision.py
  parse` routes `investigate` to a separate `investigate` output and leaves
  `decision` empty, so the consuming execute/close steps stay dormant. The
  handler's Investigate step then (1) re-renders the card with the box cleared
  (`apply_decision.py clear-checkbox`, on `github.token` so the edit never
  re-triggers the handler) so the owner can investigate again after new commits,
  and (2) triggers the ONE investigation workflow (`deep-review.yml`). It triggers
  it via `workflow_dispatch` - NOT by applying the `needs-deep-review` label -
  because a `github.token`-applied label would not raise the `labeled` webhook
  (the very recursion barrier that stops the handler re-triggering itself), and
  using `FLEET_TOKEN` to label THIS repo's card would break token discipline and
  portability (a public Wheelhouse's `FLEET_TOKEN` need not even have write access
  here). `workflow_dispatch` via `github.token` IS the documented exception to
  recursion-prevention, so it reliably fires; that is why decision-handler needs
  `actions: write`. The dispatch carries the parsed `repo`/`number`/`kind`/
  `head_sha` from the tick event, and `deep-review.yml` uses those immutable
  inputs for bot-dispatched runs instead of re-reading the mutable card body.
  Owner-triggered `workflow_dispatch` can also be run with only `issue=...` for direct verification; that path fetches and parses the current card body with `github.token`.
  Every direct Claude action in the separately permissioned model workflow has `allowed_bots: github-actions[bot]`, because a bot-triggered trusted caller retains that exact actor in the reusable model job and the action otherwise rejects the run before it emits `execution_file`.
  Keep that allow-list exact - never `*` and never an external bot actor.
  The manual `needs-deep-review` label path is unchanged (a human applying it raises the `labeled` event normally) and remains a card-body parse path in `deep-review.yml`, alongside owner-triggered issue-only `workflow_dispatch` verification runs.
  This is a deliberate asymmetry: the manual label and issue-only workflow-dispatch paths authorize only the repository owner.
  A configured co-maintainer uses the Investigate checkbox, which runs through the maintainer-gated decision-handler (`wheelhouse_core.maintainers()` = owner + configured maintainer).
  `investigate` is in the
  per-kind `ALLOWED` set but is filtered out of the NL verb list/validation
  (`nl_allowed`): an investigation is a deliberate click, not free-text intent, so
  the NL path neither offers nor accepts it.
- **`/request-changes <text>` is a pr-review-only, slash-command-only,
  non-terminal action - unlike `investigate`, it IS NL-selectable.** The
  `/request_changes <text>` alias is accepted too. It submits
  a GitHub `REQUEST_CHANGES` PR review (`POST
  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` with `{"body": text, "event":
  "REQUEST_CHANGES"}`) via `apply_decision.do_request_changes`, executed on the
  same `execute`-step `FLEET_TOKEN` wiring `do_merge`/`do_comment` already use -
  no new secret, no new token scope, no new workflow step. It is slash-only
  (like `comment`; `decline` is also omitted from checkboxes so a slash command
  can carry a custom reason) because GitHub issue-form checkboxes can't carry
  free text, so it is NOT a `CHECKBOX_OPTIONS` entry in `render_card.py` - only
  `SLASH` table entries in `apply_decision.py` and a `SLASH_HINT` mention.
  It is routed through the normal
  `decision`/`cmd_execute` path (unlike `investigate`, which is routed apart via
  `NON_CONSUMING_ACTIONS`), but its terminal state is `"none"` - the same
  leave-the-card-open shape as `do_comment` - so it never closes the card.
  Like `merge`, it re-checks the PR head SHA from the card state before posting the review; if the head moved, no review is posted and the card stays pending so the next scan can refresh it to the current head.
  Because it is a normal text-bearing verb (not a meta-action like
  `investigate`), it is deliberately NOT added to `NL_EXCLUDED_ACTIONS`: it IS
  in `nl_allowed("pr-review")`, so the natural-language intent-mapper can choose
  it on its own judgment, with prompt guidance (`VERB_HELP["request-changes"]`
  in `apply_decision.build_nl_prompt`) telling it to prefer `request-changes`
  over `comment` for a blocking revision request, and over `close`/`decline`
  when the PR is salvageable and should be revised rather than rejected.
  `route_decision` requires non-empty `free_text` for `request-changes` (like
  `comment`), downgrading to `clarify` if the model omits it. Defensive-only
  additions (not new guards): `do_request_changes` checks the PR author against
  `owner` before calling the API and returns a clear error instead of a raw 422
  (GitHub rejects self-review) - belt-and-suspenders, since the queue author
  filter already excludes owner/maintainer/bot-authored PRs from ever getting a
  card; and repeated `/request-changes` calls simply post another GitHub review
  each time (allowed by the API) rather than any dismiss/supersede logic - by
  design, "one review per push cycle" is a documented convention, not enforced
  code. Security note: unlike a plain comment, a "changes requested" review can
  put the target PR into a merge-blocked state under branch-protection
  required-reviews - a real (if reversible) effect on the target repo, so this
  is the one action added to the NL-selectable set since `investigate` was
  excluded from it.
  When `pending_contributor_cleanup` is active for that repo and `pr` is an
  effective cleanup target, `do_request_changes` also arms the target PR for
  stale cleanup after the review POST succeeds.
  Arming requires a non-maintainer human target author, the current head SHA, a
  review id, and a provable `submitted_at` timestamp (reread by review id if the
  POST response omits it).
  It writes a hidden `wheelhouse-pending-contributor-action` marker comment and
  adds `wheelhouse:pending-contributor-action`.
  Any arming failure is cleanup-only: the review stays posted, the card remains
  open, and the result message says stale cleanup was not armed.
- **Stale pending-contributor cleanup is PR-only, deterministic, and fail-open.**
  It applies only after a successful captain `/request-changes` review. Merge
  conflicts, CI routing, and rebase nudges are never contributor asks. Existing
  `needs-rebase` records are read only to silently remove their pending label;
  they never produce a reminder or closure. The request-changes lane remains
  unchanged: full target activity proof, a visible reminder before close, and
  every unreadable or ambiguous fact fails open. See
  `scripts/wheelhouse_core.py` and `tests/test_pending_contributor_cleanup.py`.
- NL conversation memory is owner-scoped, and the scoping IS the security
  boundary. `decision-handler.yml` fetches the card's thread (`nl-comments`,
  `github.token`) and `apply_decision.py assemble_history` renders it as a
  "Conversation so far" block of trusted context - but ONLY comments authored by
  a maintainer or by the workflow bot (`github-actions[bot]`, the assistant's own
  prior turns) survive. The maintainer set is exactly `wheelhouse_core.maintainers()`
  (repo owner + optional configured `maintainer`) - the SAME notion the
  `gate`/`authorized` path uses; do not invent a second rule. Every other author
  (a contributor, a third-party bot) is dropped ENTIRELY so unauthorized text can
  never enter the LLM's instruction context. The triggering comment is excluded
  from history by id (`github.event.comment.id`) because it is still passed
  separately as the single new instruction; the history is context only. None of
  this widens the acting trust model: optional `READONLY_TOKEN` search output is
  also untrusted reference data, the LLM still never gets `FLEET_TOKEN`, and
  `nl-route`'s allowlist re-validation is unchanged.
- `wheelhouse_core.py scan` is resilient: a repo that fails to read is reported as a
  warning (`ok:false`) and skipped, and `reconcile.py` must never close cards for
  an `ok:false` repo (state unknown).
  Open PRs, open issues, and PR closing issue references are paginated.
  If any of those pagination paths cannot complete, the repo result is marked
  `truncated` and `reconcile.py` must not self-heal close existing cards for that
  repo because state is incomplete.
  If the PR list or closing-reference scan is incomplete, `build_repo` withholds
  issue-triage cards for that repo because it cannot prove which issues are
  already addressed by open PRs.
  **Scan queries are kept small and survivable (card #411).** A large repo (~100
  open PRs) made the one-shot scan query 5xx persistently, so `build_repo`
  returned `ok:false` every scan and froze that repo's whole card slice. Page
  sizes are deliberately small - `PR_PAGE_SIZE`/`ISSUE_PAGE_SIZE` plus reduced
  nested `labels`/`closingIssuesReferences` counts (the existing cursor loop +
  `truncated` fallback carry the rest); `statusCheckRollup.contexts` stays large
  on purpose (truncating checks could hide a failing gate = a false green, the
  card #392 lesson). Every `gh api graphql` call goes through `_gh_graphql_data`,
  which retries transient 5xx/timeout (and GraphQL query-timeout `errors`) with
  exponential backoff + jitter (`_sleep` is indirected for tests); a non-transient
  error or exhausted retries still raises, preserving the `ok:false`/`truncated`
  fail-safe - retry never fabricates completeness.
  **The `build_repo` "scan failed" warning is slug-prefixed** so a dark repo is
  identifiable straight from the log (it used to carry no repo name).
- **Fleet-scan health ledger (loud signal for a persistently-dark repo).** A repo
  that fails EVERY scan hides behind an otherwise-green scheduled run.
  `scan-backstop.yml`'s final `always()` step runs `wheelhouse_core.py scan-health
  scan.json` (default `GITHUB_TOKEN` - this repo's own bookkeeping, never
  `FLEET_TOKEN`), which persists a per-repo consecutive-`ok:false` count in a
  dedicated CLOSED issue in THIS repo carrying a hidden `wheelhouse-scan-health`
  marker (found by the `wheelhouse:scan-health` label; state lives in GitHub, not
  on disk). `ok:true` resets the count; `ok:false` increments; at
  `SCAN_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD` consecutive failures (default 3, env-overridable
  via `WHEELHOUSE_SCAN_HEALTH_THRESHOLD`) it prints `::error::` per dark repo and
  exits non-zero to fail the run. It runs LAST so it never skips reconcile, and
  fails OPEN on any ledger I/O or missing scan.json (bookkeeping must never turn a
  scan red on its own hiccup). Pure helpers
  `parse_scan_health`/`update_scan_health`/`render_scan_health_body` are
  unit-tested; unscanned repos are carried forward and never alert.
- **Queue author filter.**
  Decision cards are for other people's work, so `build_repo` suppresses cards for PRs and issues authored by the canonical maintainer set (`wheelhouse_core.maintainers()` = repo owner plus optional configured `maintainer`) or by bots.
  Bot detection uses the GraphQL `author.__typename == "Bot"` signal plus the `*[bot]` login suffix fallback.
  Missing or unreadable author metadata fails open, so an unknown author can still raise a card rather than silently dropping a human contributor's work.
  The author filter suppresses card emission only; for fork PRs in `needs-ci-approval`, the normal safety-gated auto-approve/noop path still runs first so safe owner, maintainer, and bot CI runs do not hang awaiting approval.
  This deliberately bypasses the global or per-repo `auto_approve_ci: false` opt-out only for those author-excluded ci-approval PRs; contributor PRs still honor the opt-out and card as before.
  Unsafe, uncertain, or failed owner, maintainer, and bot CI-approval targets still do not emit cards, but they keep the scan-log warning.
  Skipped targets still remain in `open_pr_numbers` / `open_issue_numbers` but are absent from the `items` worklist, so `reconcile.py` advances the fixed two-scan soft-close lifecycle for any existing pure `needs-decision` owner, maintainer, or bot card on each qualifying scan.
- **Mergeability is display-only for readiness.** `MERGEABLE`, `CONFLICTING`,
  and `UNKNOWN` never change PR queue membership, card lifecycle, or source
  permission policy. A conflicted green PR is merge-ready; GitHub's lazy
  `UNKNOWN` calculation is not polled or frozen. Auto-merge G4/G7 remains
  clean-state-only. See `wheelhouse_core.classify` and
  `tests/test_merge_conflict.py`.
- **Approve safe fork CI, wait for terminal checks, then classify.**
  `build_repo` reports freshly approved and `ci-running` contributor PRs in `ci_wait_pr_numbers`, and reconcile freezes their existing `PR_KINDS` cards against self-heal consumption until checks become terminal.
  Author-excluded, unsafe or unverifiable, and verified-noop PRs are not frozen; approval eligibility remains the shared `ci_safety` verdict plus head verification.
  `ci_wait_refresh_items` are refresh-only `pr-review` invalidation candidates: reconcile may use one to update an existing same-kind pure `needs-decision` card, but must never create a card or queue triage for that transient revision.
  The bulk scan attaches `wheelhouse.review-observation/v2`; every attempted approval also emits a head-bound `wheelhouse.target-action-receipt/v1`. Approved or uncertain effects invalidate approval phase, check phase, comp, tests, and bucket. The provisional item therefore never repeats `needs-ci-approval` after a successful receipt.
  Before any existing CI-wait card write, reconcile re-reads the exact PR under `WHEELHOUSE_FLEET_TOKEN` through `wheelhouse_core.observe_exact_pr`, which uses the same complete-context `check_status` reduction, independent action-required enumeration, and normal classifier as scan. It restores the default card token before `render_card.upsert_card`; card snapshot CAS remains unchanged.
  A complete terminal reread uses normal classification; a complete non-terminal reread projects `ci-running` with an as-of time. Incomplete, failed, ambiguous, or expected-head-mismatched reads project explicit `ci-state-unknown`/unknown values against the actually observed head and never claim current green or current approval-needed state. A successful same-head approval receipt can never project `needs-ci-approval`.
  The rendered card persists `wheelhouse.card-projection-ref/v1` and visible current/pending/unknown as-of wording. Terminal checks observed on the next bulk scan still release the freeze and resume normal triage/lifecycle handling.
  Wheelhouse can first observe a target head change through the best-effort hourly `scan-backstop` or an optional source-repo `repository_dispatch`; neither is guaranteed before the next scan.
  At or after the first successful observation-driven refresh, a card cannot display the old head as current; before then, and after a failed corrective refresh, acting paths remain safe because the decision-handler rechecks the pinned head SHA.
  See `tests/test_ci_autoapprove.py` for receipts/emission, `tests/test_target_observation.py` for contracts/planning, `tests/test_target_reconcile_transaction.py` for production-composed timed transitions, and `tests/test_reconcile.py` for refresh, freeze, and release coverage.
- **Conflicts stay captain-owned.** Wheelhouse never asks a contributor to
  rebase, never sends a rebase reminder, and never closes for rebase inactivity.
  Phase 0 leaves a manual `/merge` conflict retryable with captain-facing copy.
  The later assisted flow is captain-initiated and must resolve in place on the
  original PR branch; auto-merge remains clean-state-only.

- **Fork source permission policy.** Bulk and exact reads derive a material
  `pushability` fact. A personal fork with `maintainerCanModify: true` is the
  only fork candidate for the future in-place path. Organization-owned,
  explicitly non-editable, or proven non-fork sources are policy-rejected.
  Unavailable or deleted-looking source metadata remains unverified and can
  never authorize contact or closure. The ordered Phase 0 transaction is exact
  source proof -> FLEET_TOKEN notice ->
  github.token audit card -> exact source proof -> FLEET_TOKEN close -> atomic
  terminal card record. Incomplete source facts are a retryable, inert
  `pushability-unverified` card - no CI approval, model work, contributor
  comment, or closure. `scripts/maintainer_edits_policy.py` owns the ordered
  notice/close transaction; `CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the disclosure. Phase 0
  must remain credential-free. README.md's "Future assisted-merge credential"
  section owns the later phase's credential and confinement contract.

- **Scan-time fork-CI auto-approve (kill the routine "approve CI" click).** One
  shared `ci_safety(slug, pr, repo_posture)` verdict is the single security
  definition; `approve_ci` uses it too, so the auto path is a STRICT SUBSET of the
  manual gate. The verdict combines (a) **risky files** (`_risky_ci_files`: the
  PR touches `.github/workflows`/`.github/actions`/`action.yml(.yaml)` - the
  pwn-request HOLD, unchanged, fails closed) and (b) the per-repo
  **`pull_request_target` posture** (`repo_pr_target_posture`: read the DEFAULT
  branch's `.github/workflows/*.yml|*.yaml` ONCE per repo - never per PR - and
  see whether any workflow triggers on `pull_request_target`; fails closed if the
  workflows can't be read/parsed). Any PR whose base ref is not the repo default
  branch fails closed (posture-present, never auto-approved). A
  `pull_request_target` workflow that ALSO
  checks out the PR head (`_checks_out_pr_head`) is flagged LOUDLY as the exploit
  pattern (best-effort - parses jobs/steps; note the YAML 1.1 gotcha where the
  bare `on:` key parses as boolean `True`, handled in `_on_triggers`). In
  `build_repo` (the `FLEET_TOKEN` scan context), for each fork
  `needs-ci-approval` PR: if the verdict is `safe` (no risky files, no posture,
  no read error) and auto-approve is enabled or the author is excluded as
  owner/maintainer/bot, call `approve_ci`; `approved` and verified `noop` both emit NO card
  (log a `::notice::` to stderr - never stdout, which carries scan.json), while
  `hold`/`error`/throw fall back to a `ci-approval` card carrying the safety
  warning for contributor-authored PRs.
  Otherwise emit the `ci-approval` card exactly as before for contributor-authored
  PRs, carrying the safety warning.
  **Fail closed everywhere**: an unsafe verdict, a `hold`/`error` from the approve,
  or an approve that throws all fall back to a card for contributor-authored PRs;
  owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs are not approved and instead log
  `suppressed-card` with no decision card.
  `ci-approval` is fork-only: same-repo PRs with no CI signal route to
  `review-needed`, while unknown fork status fails safe by raising a manual
  `ci-approval` card with no auto-approve attempt for contributor-authored PRs
  and by logging `suppressed-card` for owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs.
  The exact-current-head discovery and per-run approval contract lives in [README.md's Security notes](README.md#security-notes); `tests/test_ci_autoapprove.py` guards the masked-context, duplicate-run, and unchanged safety-boundary regressions.
  An `approve_ci` `noop` is a verified "nothing awaiting approval" state, so the
  scan emits no worklist item and reconcile starts the fixed soft-close lifecycle documented in the state-block contract above for any stale card; if a real
  pending run appears on a later scan, the normal approve/card/suppressed-card
  path runs again.
  A verified `approve_ci` `noop` remains a no-card result; mergeability never
  adds a contributor contact, a rebase cleanup record, or a scan freeze.
  Fork-originated `action_required` workflow runs are expected to have an empty `workflow_run.pull_requests` list, so `approve_ci` verifies that fork case with the already-filtered run's exact `head_sha` plus `head_branch`; non-empty `pull_requests` stays strict and must contain exactly the target PR.
  **Observability (every outcome is logged, never silent).** `_auto_approve_or_card`
  returns `(handled, card_note, log_note, approve_status)` and `build_repo` emits exactly ONE
  stderr line per `needs-ci-approval` PR the auto path handles: a `::notice::`
  when approved or verified no-op, else a `::warning::wheelhouse auto-approve
  carded <repo>#<pr>: <log_note>` for contributor-authored PRs or
  `::warning::wheelhouse auto-approve suppressed-card <repo>#<pr>: <log_note>`
  for owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs.
  The `log_note` always carries the `ci_safety` verdict `reason` and, when an approve was attempted, the
  `approve_ci` `status` + `message` (e.g. `error: <gh stderr>`, `hold`), so a real
  approve failure that used to be swallowed into the card body is now visible in
  the scan-step log - the next `scan-backstop` run shows exactly why each
  safe-looking PR was not approved. Unknown fork status is logged as a carded or
  suppressed-card warning with its uncertainty reason before safety is attempted.
  This is logging only: it never changes the verdict, the approve/card decision,
  token usage, or fail-closed behavior, the `card_note` going into
  `item["warning"]` for emitted cards is unchanged, and the line is gh
  stderr/status text, never a secret value.
  Idempotent by construction: once approved the next scan sees CI running/results
  (not `needs-ci-approval`), so it is not re-approved; a later push that adds a
  workflow file or flips the posture routes contributor-authored PRs back to a
  card and owner, maintainer, or bot-authored PRs to `suppressed-card`.
  The auto path
  runs ONLY on the `ok:true` success path of `build_repo` (an `ok:false` repo
  returns early), so an unknown-state repo is never auto-approved - the same
  invariant that bars closing its cards. Token discipline holds: the approve is a
  cross-repo write under `FLEET_TOKEN` (where scan already runs); the "no card"
  path performs no card write at all, and cards are still written later by
  `reconcile.py` under `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **Manual-path asymmetry:** risky files ->
  HARD HOLD (exit 4), unchanged; a `pull_request_target` posture does NOT
  hard-block the manual approve (`_approve_warning_suffix` only WARNS, because the
  `pull_request_target` run fires automatically with secrets regardless of this
  approval - blocking would only withhold the harmless read-only `pull_request`
  run). **Honest caveat (document, don't overclaim):** the approval gate covers
  the fork `pull_request` run; `pull_request_target` runs are NOT gated by it, so
  the posture check is a "don't silently auto-clear + make me aware" signal plus
  the loud exploit flag, not a direct block of that vector. **Config:**
  `auto_approve_ci` defaults to **`true`** when absent (so a fresh fork gets the
  noise reduction; set `false` to restore click-to-approve-everything), and a
  per-repo `auto_approve_ci: false` on any `repos:` entry overrides the global
  (`_auto_approve_enabled`). The warning is display-only (not a material refresh
  field), since a ci-approval card's existence/refresh is already driven by the
  PR's own head_sha/comp/tests.
- **CI-approval security summary (context only - the pwn-request HOLD stays).**
  A fork PR touching CI-execution files still HOLDS for manual review, unchanged
  (`ci_safety`/`approve_ci`, exit 4). `build_repo` additionally attaches a
  deterministic, read-only security summary of ONLY the changed workflow/action
  files (`wheelhouse_core.ci_security_summary` via `_attach_ci_security_summary`)
  to the emitted contributor `ci-approval` card, rendered by
  `render_card._security_review_section` as `### Security review (advisory)`.
  It surfaces the captain's categories - trigger changes (esp.
  `pull_request_target`), `permissions:` write grants, referenced secret NAMES /
  `secrets: inherit`, checkout source/ref choices (PR-head = pwn-request),
  third-party action pinning, and run-step contributor-code execution - reusing
  the existing YAML-parse helpers (`_on_triggers`, `_checks_out_pr_head`,
  `_risky_ci_files`). It reads the PR-head version of each changed file
  (`_fetch_file_text` at the head SHA via the BASE repo's contents API, which
  works for fork PR heads). **Presentation ONLY, hard invariants:** it NEVER
  approves, NEVER writes to the target, NEVER touches the hold/owner-gate/posture
  logic/classification; it reports only structured facts (names/refs), never
  verbatim file lines, so no secret VALUE can leak, and every contributor-derived
  value is code-wrapped (`_safe_inline`) so it cannot break out of the card's
  markdown. It FAILS CLOSED: any read/parse failure yields
  `CI_SUMMARY_UNANALYZABLE` ("review the diff manually") and NEVER raises, so the
  card still holds. The rendered `security_summary` string is a non-material display field (like `warning`): it never enters `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, while the state block carries only non-material cache metadata (head SHA, base-diff revision, summary format version, and whether a section is present).
  The scan cache reuses that rendered section only when its validated card labels, head SHA, and `[base_ref,base_sha]` diff revision still match, so a base move invalidates it even if the PR head does not change.
  `scan-backstop` reads this cache under the default card token before the cross-repo scan; a card-list or cache-read failure fails open to an empty cache and re-analyzes instead of skipping the fleet scan.
  A cache metadata mismatch triggers a pure-card refresh through `security_summary_stale`; existing cards otherwise pick up the section once via the `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 5 -> 6 bump.
  It runs on the `ok:true` success path only, and only for contributor-authored HOLD cards (owner/maintainer/bot ci-approval PRs are approved or suppressed with no card, so the summarizer is never consulted).
  See `tests/test_ci_security_summary.py`.
- **Scan-time auto-merge (V1) is a STRICT SUBSET of the manual merge gate, built
  on the same scan-time safe-action architecture as fork-CI auto-approve.** All
  the logic lives in `scripts/auto_merge.py` (deterministic gates, the act
  executor, the durable ledger, and the resolved-card recorder); the merge itself
  reuses `apply_decision.do_merge` unchanged. The SHIPPED CODE DEFAULT is OFF:
  `wheelhouse_core._auto_merge_enabled` returns false when the `auto_merge` key is
  absent; that absent-key fallback is the fork-and-own product default. A repo
  auto-merges nothing until it BOTH sets `auto_merge: true` (global or per-repo)
  AND commits a `VISION.md`
  on its DEFAULT branch (the alignment rubric doubles as the opt-in signal). THIS
  repository's committed `wheelhouse.config.yml` sets the GLOBAL
  `auto_merge: true`, so forks of this repository inherit the fleet-wide switch
  on and a committed default-branch `VISION.md` is the practical per-repo opt-in.
  The absent-key code fallback stays false - only this repository's
  committed config value flipped; a per-repo `auto_merge: false` opts one repo
  back out. A
  merge-ready `pr-review` candidate is merged only when EVERY gate passes:
  G0 repo opted-in + VISION.md present; G1 a pure `needs-decision` pr-review card
  (not held); G2 the PR touches none of the unconditional exclusions
  (`_auto_merge_exclusions` - a strict SUPERSET of `_risky_ci_files` covering
  workflow/action, governance, release, dependency/supply-chain,
  security/auth/credential, billing, migration, persistence/schema,
  install/bootstrap/build, public-default, and VISION.md itself); G3 the author is
  a non-bot non-maintainer with >=1 prior merged PR in the same repo
  (captain-fixed returning-contributor definition - no revert/quality history);
  G4 live `mergeable == True` AND `mergeable_state == 'clean'` (the REST twins of
  MERGEABLE/CLEAN; anything else fails closed); G5 blast radius <=20 changed files
  AND <=1000 total changed lines (captain-fixed caps, exact boundary passes);
  G6 a fresh structured `automerge_verdict` for the CURRENT head SHA
  (`verdict_eligible`) assigning an eligible A/B/C class, confirming vision
  alignment, ruling out an ineligible existing/default behavior change, and
  recommending merge. Class B additionally requires corrected-defect and
  restored-behavior claims backed by verbatim-verified exact-source evidence;
  semantic judgment (faithfulness, restoration object, contract change) is the
  triage model's attested responsibility taught by the prompt, while trusted
  code validates only mechanics - schema shapes, the shared quote byte policy,
  verbatim span binding, distinct verified references - and derives the
  contradiction record solely from the model's own declared assertion enums
  (captain decision, card #2148: no vocabulary lists or token grammars in
  trusted admission). Contradictory and historical verdicts cannot bypass it.
  Class C also requires an explicit strictly-opt-in + default-off flag. The
  detailed schema and normalization contract live in `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.
  The complete scan must also prove that no other open PR closes an issue closed by the candidate: `same_closing_issue_overlap` carries the existing `_overlap_note` result into eligibility, and a missing, malformed, or non-empty fact holds before claim or act.
  Before any action-lock mutation, `preclaim_candidates` evaluates complete G0-G6 read-only under the fleet token. Denied or unavailable candidates receive no card write. Only exact preclaim passers can be claimed under the default card token; action mode then rereads the card and reevaluates authoritative gates under claim.
  G7 is an immediate live re-check of head SHA, base SHA, default-branch VISION.md SHA, mergeable, clean state, configured compliance/test contexts, and same-closing-issue overlap right before `do_merge`.
  The overlap re-read uses `wheelhouse_core.same_closing_issue_overlap`, which strictly re-lists every open PR and reuses `_closing_issue_numbers`, `_closing_map`, and `_overlap_note`; any unreadable, incomplete, malformed, duplicate, or raced result holds in the final `do_merge` guard.
  Any missing/stale/malformed/uncertain/unreadable input HOLDS for human review (fail-closed), and an ok:false or truncated repo is frozen exactly like reconcile.
  `evaluate_candidate` returns one ordered structured criterion result using the stable schema in `automerge_criteria.py`; action decisions consume those same facts, while `collect_card_criteria` runs a read-only full evaluation for rendering.
  `scan-backstop` passes that head-bound result through `automerge.json` to `reconcile.py`, and `render_card.py` shows every row as `MET`, `UNMET`, or `UNAVAILABLE` with concise evidence.
  Every v2 PR-review triage mutation other than the no-trusted-source security fallback plans one complete result through `render_card._atomic_automerge_card_body` and commits title/body/managed labels through `projection_writer.py`. A terminal result first persists one visible durable exact-revision `assessment_record`; scheduled reconcile retries a missed projection without another reservation or model call. The fallback runs only when the trusted source is unavailable, so it cannot load code or perform fleet reads; it clears the queued cache under the default card token and renders a visible `### Triage` security-fallback warning that any temporarily stale criteria reflect the prior queued state until trusted card maintenance resumes.
  Criterion state is non-material and never read as authorization; action mode reevaluates under an exclusive card claim, and G7 plus the unchanged `do_merge` workflow-touch gate still run immediately before merge.
  Missing historical criterion data renders every row explicitly unavailable, while a changed fresh result triggers only a display refresh through `automerge_criteria_stale`.
  Every criteria-carrying card write recomputes the two admission-dependent G6 rows (`g6_triage_success`/`g6_merge_recommendation`) from the exact state it stores via the shared `render_card.triage_admission_facts`, and the staleness compare applies the same recompute, so one edit is always self-consistent and a lagging scan snapshot cannot loop (card #2148; contract in `docs/OPTION_B_CARD_PROJECTION.md`).
  A final `apply_decision._workflow_merge_gate` result of exactly `history-only-workflow-touch` after G2's complete clean net diff creates the separate NON-MATERIAL `automerge_workflow_hold` record and `wheelhouse:manual-merge-required` label/section for that head.
  The matching hold makes claim skip before any processing label, displays G7 as `UNMET`, and is preserved by same-head card maintenance and trusted soft-close reuse; a normal authoritative new-head or incompatible-kind refresh drops it with stale triage/verdict state.
  This is denial-only and remains refreshable, never generic `blocked`: `do_merge` still performs the authoritative history read for every actual merge, while unreadable/incomplete or net-diff workflow cases retain their existing generic fail-closed paths and never establish this proven-history hold.
  Hold body/label writes use only the default card token, are verified before audit-intent cleanup or claim release, and a failed persistence leaves the exclusive claim plus `final_gate_pending` audit intent for deterministic retry rather than a pure hourly reclaim loop.
  See `tests/test_automerge_card_ui.py` for the full positive/negative matrix, axi#96 lifecycle shape, old-card compatibility, and the guarantee that forged displayed `MET` rows cannot grant eligibility.
  See `tests/test_automerge_workflow_hold.py` for the two-hour no-reclaim lifecycle, head changes, persistence recovery, token boundaries, and card reuse/close behavior.
  A target repository without GitHub's "require branches to be up to date" branch protection has an irreducible sub-second window between those final GETs and GitHub's merge PUT: GitHub's merge API accepts no base-SHA precondition.
  That residual risk is bounded by the final CLEAN state, green configured checks, blast-radius caps, and unconditional exclusions.
  Enabling "require branches to be up to date" branch protection, or using a merge queue, closes it server-side because GitHub's `mergeStateStatus` becomes `BEHIND` while auto-merge requires a CLEAN merge state.
  The behavior verdict is PRODUCED by extending the pr-review triage.
  For every complete immutable diff, `triage.yml` asks for the VISION-independent behavior class, existing/default-behavior-change, and class-C opt-in/default-off facts, plus typed `behavior_assertions` and the bounded, claim-specific `class_b_restoration` evidence when the class is B.
  `render_card.normalize_automerge_verdict` owns semantic admission, and `auto_merge.behavior_verdict_facts` revalidates its versioned result for both criteria display and acting; see `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` for the detailed contract.
  It fetches base-branch VISION.md through the contents API with NO `?ref`, never the PR head, so a PR editing VISION.md cannot bless itself, and VISION.md is also a G2 exclusion.
  Only when that trusted policy exists does triage additionally ask for alignment and the final merge recommendation; `render_card.normalize_automerge_verdict` parses the independent core plus that optional all-or-nothing extension.
  The result is PERSISTED as the
  NON-MATERIAL `automerge_verdict` state key alongside `triage_recommendation`
  (never in `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, cleared on any failed/stale attempt, carried
  through same-revision refresh). Token discipline mirrors the rest of the fleet:
  the merge is a cross-repo write on FLEET_TOKEN (the "Auto-merge eligible PRs"
  step in `scan-backstop.yml`, which reads the persisted verdict from the local
  `cards.json` - no token needed to read a file), while the durable audit ledger
  (a dedicated CLOSED issue in THIS repo with the `wheelhouse-auto-merge-log`
  marker, mirroring the scan-health ledger) and the resolved decision record
  (comment + close via `render_card.close_card`) are written by the separate
  default-token "Record auto-merges" step.
  The act step uses its separate default card token only to persist a pre-merge audit intent before calling `do_merge`.
  The order is act -> record -> reconcile, and either a pre-merge intent or a staged pending audit prevents reconcile from consuming the claim until the audit has completed or a later FLEET_TOKEN pass can determine that no merge occurred.
  Kill switches (layered): the global/per-repo `auto_merge` flag, deleting a
  repo's VISION.md, removing `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (no verdict -> everything
  holds), and a per-PR `wheelhouse:no-auto-merge` target label
  (`NO_AUTO_MERGE_LABEL`). Wheelhouse NEVER auto-reverts. By captain override V1
  DELIBERATELY has NO open-PR file-overlap gate and NO per-contributor/per-scan
  rate cap - their absence is intentional and distinct from the required
  same-closing-issue ambiguity hold, and is asserted by
  `tests/test_auto_merge_v1.py` (which also covers every gate, A/B/C handling,
  malformed/stale verdicts, the 20-file/1000-line boundaries, base-branch-only
  VISION reads, the self-authorization exclusion, live re-checks, the audit
  ledger/resolved record, and the kill switches, all offline).
  Claim-time card identity must account for GitHub's one API-specific automation
  actor duality: REST issue rows use `github-actions[bot]`, while
  `render_card.get_card` returns `app/github-actions` from GraphQL.
  `auto_merge._canonical_card_author` may map only that exact GraphQL spelling to
  the REST spelling at the `_trusted_card_identity` boundary, and
  `projection_writer._canonical_automation_author` performs the same
  exact-spelling mapping where the writer compares its REST lifecycle
  expected snapshot against the `get_card` reread (the closed-card reuse
  preparation path).
  Neither may strip prefixes, fold case, or accept any other alias.
  Keep the regression fixtures in `tests/test_auto_merge_v1.py`
  `get_card`-shaped, with `author` as a `{"login": ...}` dict.
- The `repository_dispatch` event type is `wheelhouse-item`, but `ingest.yml`
  also listens for the legacy `triage-item` (`types: [wheelhouse-item,
  triage-item]`). It is a cross-repo wire contract: source repos onboarded before
  the rename still send `triage-item`, so the alias must stay until every source
  dispatcher is updated. Same idea as the state-marker back-compat - rename the
  name, keep accepting the old one.
- **Cross-repo reference qualification.** A decision card lives in THIS
  (cards) repo, but its target is a DIFFERENT repo. GitHub autolinks a bare
  `#N` to an issue/PR in whichever repo the TEXT is posted in, so any
  model-generated free text landing on a card must never contain a bare `#N`
  meant for the target - it would silently mislink to the cards repo instead.
  Every surface where model text is rendered/posted onto a card runs it
  through the one shared, deterministic `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs(text,
  owner, repo)` before display or action, which rewrites a bare GitHub-autolink `#N` to
  `owner/repo#N` (already-qualified `owner/repo#N`, full URLs, markdown-link
  URLs, and non-reference `#` uses like `GH-123`/`#123abc`/`foo#N` are left
  untouched; null-safe and idempotent). `owner` is always
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and `repo` is always the TARGET repo name from the
  card's deterministic state (`state["repo"]`) - NEVER derived from the
  model's own output, so the model cannot redirect qualification by naming a
  different repo in its text.
  For auto-triage and deep-review card text, trusted code also runs the same
  card-visible output through `render_card.label_automated_status_lines`, which
  preserves a narrow allowlist of claude-code-action harness polling/status lines
  but prefixes them with `AUTOMATED_STATUS_LABEL` as presentation metadata.
  It is deliberately line-oriented and conservative: no text is stripped, and
  action routing, owner gates, token handling, and target posting behavior are
  unchanged.
  The three live model-output surfaces: (1) auto-triage -
  `render_card.py`'s `triage_section`/`body_with_triage_result` thread
  `owner`+`state["repo"]` through before rendering the `### Triage` block, and
  label known harness status lines after qualification;
  `recommendation_for_state` plus `apply_decision._accept_recommendation` qualify
  stored `recommended_reason` text before it can drive a target comment, a
  decline/close note, or a request-changes review (the `triage-apply`/
  `triage-fail` CLI read `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and `triage.yml`'s
  "Update the decision card" step passes it through its `env -i` sandbox);
  (2) deep-review - the "Post the verdict on the card" step in
  `deep-review.yml` imports `render_card` and `wheelhouse_core` in its trusted
  Python heredoc, labels known harness status lines, and qualifies the extracted
  verdict with the `resolve` step's deterministic `repo` output before posting
  via `gh issue comment`; (3) NL answer/clarify -
  `apply_decision.route_decision` (the same trust-boundary function that
  validates the LLM's structured result) qualifies `out["answer"]` using the
  card's `state["repo"]` and a caller-supplied `owner` before returning, so
  `steps.route.outputs.answer` is already qualified by the time
  decision-handler.yml's "Post NL reply" step posts it - `cmd_nl_route` reads
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` from env and the `route` step in
  decision-handler.yml passes it through its own `env -i` sandbox.
  The same helper also runs during `_preserve_same_revision_triage` on
  same-revision refreshes, and `label_automated_status_lines` runs there too, so
  cached pre-qualification or pre-labeling `### Triage` sections in already-open
  cards are repaired before being reinserted; this is a card-body sweep only and
  does not rewrite historical card comments.
  All three
  prompts (`triage.yml`, `deep-review.yml`, and the NL prompt in
  `apply_decision.build_nl_prompt`) also carry a defense-in-depth instruction
  telling the model to write refs as `owner/repo#N`, never bare - but the
  deterministic rewrite is the load-bearing guarantee, not the prompt. The
  merge thank-you comment posted on the TARGET repo's own PR (see
  "Contributor-facing copy") is deliberately OUT OF SCOPE - a bare `#N` there
  is correct because that comment is posted in the target repo itself.

## LLM side-jobs

All agent-assisted paths now share Agent Runtime Contract `wheelhouse.agent-runtime/v1alpha1` as the provider-portability boundary.
The contract, action schemas, pinned Codex app-server protocol, capability negotiation, canonical tools, brokers, sandbox supervisor, adapters, consumers, and tests live under `agent_runtime/`, with the trusted CLI at `scripts/agent_runtime.py` and operator runbook at `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.
Every model-facing byte bound - schema maxima vs `maxFinalBytes`, repair-candidate retention, prompt budgets, and the NL trusted-history inline budget - is owned by the one `agent_runtime/size_budget.py` table ("Size budgets" in `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`, property-tested by `tests/test_size_budget.py`); never copy a size constant into a consumer.
Claude is the named production primary.
The two schema-repair actions resolve to the direct `claude-cli-pinned` profile, while the other eight actions remain on `claude-action-current-pinned`.
`agent_runtime/config.py` guards that exact split, and `temporary_rollback_profile` is the reviewed one-setting rollback for an explicit durable replay.
In production, `nl-decision.schema-repair` is the only schema-repair TASK still built: the triage correction turn reuses the ORIGINAL triage action (built by `build_correction_task` under the unchanged `triage.schema-repair` claim identity), so `triage.schema-repair` remains configured, guarded, and deployable as the disabled codex inline evidence plus rollback surface without being selected by the claude lane.
Codex CLI `0.144.0` app-server remains implemented and tested only as disabled non-target adapter evidence because the current ChatGPT Pro plus public-repository topology has no supported secure noninteractive subscription path.
No Codex secret is requested, no action targets Codex, and current selection cannot reach a Codex workflow installation path.
Provider environment overrides are rejected; secret presence cannot select a provider, model, effort, billing path, or stronger tool policy.
OpenCode with Z.AI Coding Plan is a deferred disabled candidate only; no adapter, provider call, credential request, target, fallback, or provider-specific runtime-core policy is authorized in this phase.
Fallback remains disabled.

Every spend-capable event first creates a durable default-token card claim keyed by `agent_runtime.admission.normalized_event_identity`: issue triage binds action plus exact target revision; PR triage and its correction also bind the queue-authorized review-context digest and any checked-in one-use recovery digest; NL additionally binds the exact comment ID; and deep review binds its normalized trigger identity.
Existing workflow concurrency serializes same-event claim creation, duplicate delivery exits before task construction, and consumers edit the claim rather than creating duplicate model-result comments.
AgentTask `idempotencyKey` is the normalized event-key hash.
Content-free `wheelhouse-agent-stage` records begin at admission and bind action, Wheelhouse source SHA, event-key hash, and execution ID when available; they never carry prompt, comment, target, search, or credential content.

The eight pinned Claude Action steps remain present and deployable behind the unified selection boundary; six serve the non-repair actions (and the triage correction turn, which rides the original action's own step), and two are the schema-repair rollback path.
One direct supervisor step serves both schema-repair actions because they share the same one-turn, no-tool profile.
They run only in the separately permissioned `claude-model.yml` reusable workflow after a trusted parent job uploads a bounded content-addressed `AgentTask` handoff.
Each local reusable-workflow call resolves from the caller's exact commit and also passes that commit as `expected_commit_sha`; the model job must observe the same `GITHUB_SHA` before hydration, checkpointing, or provider execution.
Every invocation step is conditional on the admitted adapter and action, and no provider failure can trigger a different adapter.
Those production steps share the same Claude **subscription** token from `claude setup-token`, never an Anthropic API key.
Every action step remains pinned to `anthropics/claude-code-action` `v1.0.178` at commit `af0559ee4f514d1ef21826982bed13f7edc3c35e` (Claude Code `2.1.215`, Agent SDK `0.3.215`) and passes the immutable `--model claude-sonnet-4-6` identifier.
The direct schema-repair lane pins `ubuntu-24.04`, installs and verifies the exact Bubblewrap package from `runtime.lock.json`, proves a minimal namespace before provider admission, verifies Claude CLI `2.1.215`, passes the OAuth token only through a private file into the Claude child environment, and uses the existing Bubblewrap supervisor with native structured output and zero tools.
Trusted preflight builds an immutable `AgentTask`, and the post-action bridge requires the execution transcript's observed `system/init.model` to match before it emits an atomic `AgentResult`.
Repository inputs are packaged by `agent_runtime/task_builder.py` from the exact bound Git commit (object DB + clean index/worktree), not from live filesystem shape: ordinary `100644`/`100755` blobs are included; committed relative mode `120000` links are materialized as regular bounded content (file links copy the target blob; directory links expand committed descendants under the alias path, with alias bytes/files counted); mode `160000` gitlinks are rejected; absolute/traversal/broken/cyclic/dirty/untracked links fail closed; no live symlink may reach the handoff or model workspace (post-snapshot handoff rejection stays).
A source checkout may be branch-attached because `actions/checkout@v4` checks an external repository's default branch out with `git checkout -B`; exact HEAD equality plus clean pre/post conditions bind that production issue-triage shape, while AgentTask `git.detached` describes the emitted content-addressed snapshot.
See `tests/test_agent_runtime_repo_snapshot.py`.
The model workflow has only `actions: read` and `contents: read`, receives no `FLEET_TOKEN`, and verifies the complete handoff into a fresh workspace.
Its finalizer re-verifies the handoff, normalizes action results or accepts only the direct supervisor's atomic result, enforces task/profile binding, then exposes only a bounded verified result artifact to the trusted caller-side consumer.
The reusable model job owns the task-bound execution timeout; its finalizer normalizes only a task-bound action transcript plus observed enforcement record, or accepts the direct supervisor's atomic result.
The pinned claude-code-action owns its model process, so the task-bound job timeout must include setup and finalization overhead. Terminal triage errors do not self-heal or retry automatically; the operator-run exact-card replay remains their recovery path. `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the detailed deadline policy; `tests/test_agent_runtime_child_timeout.py` pins its per-action values and single-owner wiring.
Trusted caller-side jobs retain default-token card writes and `FLEET_TOKEN` target operations outside the model boundary and accept only the verified normalized result artifact.

The shared injection model remains unchanged: only trusted workflow prompts and owner/maintainer-authored text are instructions; target content and optional search output are delimited untrusted data; and no model process receives `FLEET_TOKEN`.

- **`triage.yml` - automatic, lightweight, advisory PR-card OR issue-card context.** Triggered by `scan-backstop` / `reconcile.py` and the ingest fast path for pure `needs-decision` pr-review OR issue-triage cards whose current revision (a PR's `head_sha`, or an issue's `updated_at`) does not match `triaged_sha`; if the card is held under `pending-triage`, the update path also publishes its real checkboxes fail-open.
  pr-review is opt-out through `auto_triage`; issue-triage is opt-out through the INDEPENDENT `auto_triage_issues` - both global default true, per-repo override allowed, and both inert unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is present. Neither flag affects the other.
  For a pr-review card it checks out the target PR head read-only with `FLEET_TOKEN`, `persist-credentials: false`, and verifies the head did not move since queueing.
  For an issue-triage card it checks out the repo's DEFAULT branch read-only the same way (same substrate `deep-review.yml` uses for an issue card) - there is no head to verify.
  Both paths then run Claude with lower `--max-turns` than deep-review to produce structured `{summary, product_implications, recommended_action, recommended_reason, evidence}` context; the issue-triage prompt fetches the issue's title/body/comments (no diff), the pr-review prompt the PR title/body/diff, each with its own action set. PR triage still requires a complete native ReviewObservation and exact observation binding, but a well-formed bound `truncated` or `unavailable` related-work context may run as visible advisory prose. `assessment_admission.py` remains strict about the target - exact observation/head binding, observation completeness, and check-basis truth - while DecisionContext status, content, or `context_id` rotation never creates or withholds Accept, G6, or action authority. The model sees related candidates only through `decision_context.compact_model_context`: deterministic status/counts plus at most 10 concise titles and full URLs, never relation records, bodies, diffs, paths, heads, or card metadata.
  **Pass-by-reference prompt (do not reinline).**
  The runner writes verified target content to bounded `target.txt`, checks out code at `target-src/`, and names those files in a small, target-size-independent prompt for Read/Grep/Glob; target content and `vision.md` must never be copied into the action `prompt:` input.
  `DIFF_COMPLETE` means the whole non-binary/LFS/submodule diff is present within the 1,500,000-byte on-disk cap; truncation fails closed with no auto-merge verdict.
  Required `evidence` is validation-only: `normalize_triage` rejects missing evidence, and `triage-apply` anchor-checks it against `target.txt`, failing open only when that file cannot be read.
  `tests/test_triage_prompt_size.py` owns the structural regression checks.
  Trusted code still renders the visible `### Triage` section with `github.token`, never by Claude directly, and labels known harness polling/status transcript lines as automated status.
  That section carries analysis only - summary, product implications, and the honest primary-failure/admission warnings - never the model's advisory action (see "One canonical recommendation surface" in Sharp edges).
  When the structured action is fresh, successful, per-kind allowlisted, and has any required reason text, trusted code persists `triage_recommendation` and may add the `Accept recommendation` checkbox.
  The result is advisory until the owner/maintainer ticks that checkbox, at which point `apply_decision.py` maps it to an existing deterministic action with the same guards.
  Apart from publishing a held card's own `pending-triage` label and placeholder decision section, plus that conditional accept shortcut, it never changes classification, managed labels, merge/close/approve behavior, fork-CI safety, author filtering, or conflict routing.
  Before dispatch, the queueing path writes `triaged_sha=<current revision>` and `triage_status=queued`, so errors and timeouts fail open without retriggering the same revision on every scan.
  Existing open cards of either kind with no `triaged_sha` are intentionally stale and backfill once on the next eligible scan.
  Optional `READONLY_TOKEN` search uses the unchanged `wheelhouse-search` wrapper and remains untrusted evidence only.
  On the exact `triage.pr.search` action, the wrapper's existing bounded anonymous `public_clone` operation lets the model act as the independent reviewer for applicable trusted VISION source criteria. The structured verdict distinguishes local-only policy from external-source-dependent policy. An external-source-positive verdict must match the trusted post-turn URL/ref/commit/manifest record and exact-file SHA-256 observations that `verify_public_clone_claims` derives by re-cloning and independently observing each successful in-turn claim; failed claims are not cloned again, and their records contain only re-validated source values plus a trusted failure token. Missing, forged, failed, ambiguous, mismatched, or unobserved evidence drops the VISION-positive fields. Contributor assertions are leads, never independent evidence. This is source-only: target, cloned, and package execution remain forbidden, and requirements exceeding that capability fail closed.
  **Nothing in a model turn may require privilege (cards #2320/#1483/#1676/#1398).** Wheelhouse sets `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB: "1"` on every pinned Claude action step, which makes Claude Code wrap EVERY model Bash command in `bwrap --unshare-user --cap-drop ALL --unshare-pid`; `sudo` and every other escalation is impossible there. A `sudo`-based provenance write inside the broker therefore failed on both the success and failure paths, converting every completed clone into `trusted public clone provenance recording failed` and blocking all axi catalog vision verdicts. Trusted state a model turn produces must be verified AFTER the turn instead: `nl_readonly_search.verify_public_clone_claims` re-clones successful claims in the trusted post-turn step and independently derives their recorded facts; failure records contain only re-validated source values and a trusted failure token. Bookkeeping must also never replace a real error - the failure path records best-effort and re-raises the original. Guarded by `tests/test_public_clone.py` (`test_sandboxed_turn_never_escalates_privilege`, `test_post_turn_verification_owns_every_recorded_fact`) and the catalog acceptance case in `tests/test_public_clone_e2e.py`.
  **A non-empty prose `VISION.md` is sufficient and is the documented opt-in** (README, `docs/ONBOARDING.md`, `wheelhouse.config.yml`). Vision alignment remains the model's attested semantic judgment; the optional `wheelhouse-vision-source-dependencies` declaration only narrows admission when one of its criteria applies. `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the complete declaration and binding contract, and `tests/test_automerge_card_ui.py` owns the regression matrix. The vision-bound UNAVAILABLE rows and the card's `_needs VISION.md_` hint are driven by the card's `triaged_vision_sha` and the actual `g0_vision_present` result, never by a substring over child evidence.
  The Claude action allows only `github-actions[bot]`, never `*`, because scan/ingest dispatches use `github.token`.
  `render_card.py triage-apply`/`triage-fail` take a kind-agnostic `--revision` CLI argument (a PR's head SHA or an issue's `updated_at`), replacing the old pr-review-only `--head-sha` flag name.
  Result delivery is independent of transcript retention: `triage-result` extracts the compact final result event before applying the 262144-byte cap solely to the retained debug transcript.
  `tests/test_triage_result_delivery.py` guards this ordering and the uncapped direct extraction in `deep-review.yml`.
  The single context-equivalent triage correction and its authority rules are
  owned by `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`; see
  `tests/test_triage_schema_repair.py` for regression coverage.
- **`deep-review.yml` - ALWAYS-ON, code-grounded (no enable flag).** Triggered by ticking the **Investigate** box on a card, by the repo owner applying the `needs-deep-review` label, or by the repo owner running `workflow_dispatch` with only `issue=...` for direct verification.
  Bot-dispatched Investigate runs use the immutable target inputs passed by `decision-handler.yml`; owner issue-only runs and manual label runs parse the current card body with `github.token`.
  It checks out the TARGET's code read-only (`FLEET_TOKEN`, `persist-credentials: false`, the PR head for a review card / the default branch for an issue card) and runs Claude restricted to `--allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob` over that checkout when search is disabled - so it traces real code paths, never just the diff, and can NEVER execute the target's code.
  It uses the same pass-by-reference prompt invariant as `triage.yml`; only the bounded decision-card body remains inline.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is absent, this remains the production no-search path: no shell `GH_TOKEN`, no Bash tool, and `github_token: github.token`.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is present, Claude also uses that read-only public-scoped token as both the action `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN`, plus `Write` for `search-request.json` and `Bash(wheelhouse-search)`.
  This direct in-process token exposure is deliberate; see `docs/READONLY_TOKEN_DELIVERY.md` for the accepted decision and tradeoff.
  The wrapper is still the existing `scripts/nl_readonly_search.py` install path, scoped to the target repo plus configured fleet repos, so deep-review can cross-reference related, duplicate, or superseding PRs/issues and code context.
  Search output is UNTRUSTED DATA and advisory evidence only; the model still produces only verdict text, and `FLEET_TOKEN` never reaches it.
  No deterministic downstream step reads raw model output because the trusted bridge validates the action `execution_file` and exposes only `AgentResult`.
  Claude does not write a verdict file.
  The Claude action allows only `github-actions[bot]` as a bot actor so the maintainer-gated Investigate dispatch can pass; it must not allow `*` or any external bot actor.
  Its final response is captured by the trusted bridge from the action's `execution_file`, after exact observed-model validation, by preferring the clean `type: "result"` event's `result` string and falling back to the last assistant text.
  The deterministic consumer then labels known harness polling/status transcript lines, qualifies target refs, and posts that text as a card comment with `github.token`.
  If no usable output is present, the workflow posts "Deep review ran but produced no verdict (see the workflow run logs)." and fails the run.
  The ONLY gate is `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`: when it is ABSENT the workflow posts a one-line "Deep-review needs CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN configured to run." note instead of silently no-opping.
  Manual triggering means there is no runaway-cost reason for a config flag, so the old `deep_review` flag was removed entirely - config, `load_config`, and the `deep-review-enabled` CLI.
- **`nl_decisions`** in `decision-handler.yml`: a plain-English owner/maintainer comment is
  mapped to a structured result (see Sharp edges).
  Opt-in: inert unless `nl_decisions: true` AND `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  present.
  `READONLY_TOKEN` is optional.
  Both primary Claude branches pass the exact content-bound canonical `nl-decision-v1` schema through the pinned action's `--json-schema` support. The bridge prefers terminal `structured_output`; when that carrier alone is absent, it may accept the terminal `result` only after strict JSON parsing and validation against the same bound schema.
  The trusted bridge independently enforces the byte bound, schema, task binding, and downstream `nl-route` allowlist before anything can be posted or acted on; native generation and plain terminal JSON are never treated as trusted validation by themselves.
  Absent or genuinely invalid results fail closed into the one bounded `nl-decision.schema-repair` turn, which runs through the direct `claude-cli-pinned` worker on Claude Code `2.1.215` and must itself return native structured output.
  If it is absent, Claude stays in the production no-shell mode (`--allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob`), has no `GH_TOKEN`, and runs no commands. The model is never asked to hand-serialize a decision file; trusted code parses and serializes result objects.
  If it is present, Claude also uses `READONLY_TOKEN` as the action
  `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN`, plus the
  `Bash(wheelhouse-search)` allow-list (tools
  `Read,Grep,Glob,Write,Bash(wheelhouse-search)`) so it can run scoped read-only
  `gh` searches across the target repo and configured fleet repos for related,
  duplicate, or superseding PRs/issues and code context.
  On the exact `nl-decision.search` and `triage.pr.search` actions only, the
  wrapper also accepts one anonymous `public_clone` request with a complete
  public HTTPS Git URL and optional safe ref. It retains
  one bounded, shallow, no-tags/no-submodules/no-LFS/no-hooks data-only clone
  under `RUNNER_TEMP` for Read/Grep/Glob. In-turn claims are untrusted; the
  trusted post-turn verifier re-clones successful claims and derives every
  recorded fact independently before the workflow removes the clone and claim
  log. Git receives a fresh credential-free environment; the authenticated
  `gh` owner/fleet allowlist is unchanged. See
  `docs/READONLY_TOKEN_DELIVERY.md` for the accepted DNS-rebinding residual and
  `tests/test_public_clone.py` / `tests/test_public_clone_e2e.py` for guards.
  Like `triage.yml`/`deep-review.yml`, the NL prompt is pass-by-reference:
  `nl-fetch` writes target title/body/diff to bounded on-disk `target.txt` with
  an explicit truncation marker, while `apply_decision.build_nl_prompt` only
  names the file.
  Target content must never be inlined into the Claude `prompt:`/`ALL_INPUTS`.
  If the LLM step fails before routing, the final recovery step posts one
  bounded, content-free, marker-keyed card note with `github.token` and changes
  no label, gate, or decision.
  See `tests/test_nl_prompt_size.py`.
  Because `READONLY_TOKEN` is a fine-grained, public-read PAT, it cannot answer
  `claude-code-action`'s own `GET .../collaborators/{actor}/permission`
  triggering-actor check, so that read-only branch also sets
  `allowed_non_write_users: ${{ github.event.sender.login }}` to bypass that
  check - narrowly, for the exact sender the workflow's own `steps.gate`
  (`wheelhouse_core.py authorized`) has already proven is the owner or
  configured maintainer, never `'*'`. That workflow gate remains the real
  trust boundary; the action's built-in check is redundant once it has run.
  This does not touch what token the model can act with - `github_token`/
  `GH_TOKEN` stay `READONLY_TOKEN`, so the model still cannot write anywhere.
  Do not widen `allowed_non_write_users` to `'*'` or drop the `steps.gate`
  authorization it relies on.
  The prompt carries the card's prior thread as owner-scoped conversation history
  so follow-up questions keep continuity (see the conversation-memory bullet in
  Sharp edges for the trusted-author rule).
  Deep-review uses the same wrapper under the same optional `READONLY_TOKEN`
  trust model, but only for advisory verdict context.

## Contributor-facing copy

Messages Wheelhouse posts onto **target repos** speak naturally, like a friendly maintainer bot. They must not name the product ("Wheelhouse") or use internal-state jargon ("maintainer queue", "resurface", bucket/kind names). This includes pending-contributor cleanup reminders, close comments, and the maintainer-edits policy notice.

The maintainer-edits policy notice starts with `Automated notice:` because `FLEET_TOKEN` posts as a human login. Its exact contributor-facing copy is owned by `scripts/maintainer_edits_policy.py`; it explains the personal-fork **Allow edits from maintainers** requirement and never asks the contributor to rebase.

Owner-facing decision cards and comments on **this repo's** issues are the private queue; those may keep the Wheelhouse name and internal vocabulary.

**The one sanctioned contributor `@`-mention.** `do_merge` in `apply_decision.py` posts a short, friendly thank-you comment on a fleet contributor's PR after a successful card-driven merge (checkbox `merge` or NL "merge it"), `@`-mentioning the contributor by `pr["user"]["login"]`.
This is a deliberate, narrow exception to "never `@`-mention" - that rule is about the owner's private decision cards in *this* repo, never about a comment posted on the *contributor's own* target-repo PR, where a thank-you tag is normal OSS etiquette.
It is gated by `thank_on_merge` (default true, per-repo override via `wheelhouse_core._thank_on_merge_enabled`, mirroring `auto_approve_ci`); no LLM is involved and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is irrelevant to it.
The message is either the built-in default or the owner's own `thank_on_merge_message` config (an `{author}` placeholder substituted with the trusted bare login; templates include `@{author}` when they want a GitHub mention, never with untrusted target content); a per-repo message override wins over the global one (`wheelhouse_core._thank_on_merge_message`).
Owner, configured-maintainer, and bot (`*[bot]` login suffix) authors are skipped silently, as is a missing/blank author.
It runs on the same `FLEET_TOKEN` acting path as the merge itself (`_comment_target`, no new token) and strictly AFTER the `PUT .../merge` succeeds - never on already-merged/not-open/head-moved/failed-merge outcomes.
It is best-effort by construction (`_thank_contributor` swallows every exception to a `::warning::` and always leaves `do_merge`'s success result - `("Merged ...", "resolved")` - untouched): a thank-you failure must never flip a successful merge to `error`/`blocked` or trigger a retry.

## Validation

No build step.
Use the authoritative [local validation command list](CONTRIBUTING.md#local-validation).
The notes below record selected non-obvious regression coverage:

- `python tests/test_agent_runtime_contract.py`, `test_agent_runtime_capabilities.py`, `test_agent_runtime_security.py`, `test_agent_runtime_lifecycle.py`, `test_agent_runtime_consumers.py`, `test_agent_runtime_workflows.py`, `test_agent_runtime_repo_snapshot.py`, `test_agent_runtime_admission.py`, `test_agent_runtime_result_binding.py`, and `test_agent_outage_recovery_gate.py` - offline Agent Runtime Contract v1 coverage for strict schemas and hashing, fail-before-spend negotiation, the pinned disabled Codex app-server protocol evidence, exact typed tools and external sandbox boundary, redaction, cancellation and process-group cleanup, malformed/missing/delivered results, all action-profile consumers, explicit Claude production selection wiring with fallback disabled, exact event admission and result/event binding, the complete provider-free eight-path ZIP/fresh-interpreter recovery gate, hosted artifact preservation of signed hidden paths, and Git-object-oracle repository packaging (committed relative symlinks materialize as regular content; absolute/traversal/dirty/gitlink denials; Firstmate-style `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/skills` fixtures).
- `python tests/test_decision.py` - mocks the LLM, no network, and also covers the non-consuming investigate routing, allow-set, `clear_checkbox`, the pre-merge workflow-touch gate (it inspects net-diff + history `.github/workflows/**`, checks both sides of a rename, returns terminal `blocked` with manual UI-merge guidance, fails closed on incomplete reads, and does not Workflows-gate action.yml), the `thank_on_merge` post-merge thank-you (config on/off, per-repo override, owner/maintainer/bot skip, custom-message substitution, best-effort swallow, and every non-success merge outcome posting none), that `route_decision` qualifies bare cross-repo refs in `answer`/`clarify` replies using `STATE["repo"]` + owner, never the model's own text, and that a HELD card (render_card.py "Held cards") is inert to `cmd_parse` (checkbox tick and slash-command alike) and `cmd_nl_eligible`, while the identical card once published is actionable again. Also covers `request-changes`: it is pr-review-only in `ALLOWED` (not ci-approval/issue-triage) and, unlike `investigate`, IS in `nl_allowed`; `/request-changes <text>` and its `/request_changes` alias slash-parse to the action with the text as free_text (and parse to nothing without text, or when the card's kind doesn't allow it); the `decision:request-changes` label path is ignored because labels cannot carry review text; `route_decision` drives `execute` for a well-formed request-changes action, downgrades to `clarify` when `free_text` is missing or the kind disallows it, and the built NL prompt lists `request-changes` with its judgment guidance for pr-review only; and `do_request_changes` (mocked `gh_rest`) posts exactly one `POST .../pulls/{n}/reviews` with `{"body": text, "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES"}` and a `"none"` (card-stays-open) terminal state, refuses with a clear error (no API call) when the PR author is the repo owner, rejects blank review text before any API call, surfaces a raw API failure as an `"error"` terminal state, and only arms pending-contributor cleanup when config/targets allow it and the target author is a non-maintainer human.
- `python tests/test_nl_decisions_search.py` - offline YAML wiring checks for the optional READONLY_TOKEN search path, scoped actor-check bypass, token isolation, prompt gating, unchanged `nl-route`/`execute` boundary, the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` threading into the `route` step's `env -i` sandbox, the NL prompt's cross-repo-qualification instruction, and that `route_decision` qualification is driven by deterministic state rather than model-claimed repos.
- `python tests/test_nl_schema_repair.py` - native-first NL structured output, schema-valid terminal-result admission, and bounded direct repair, no network: exact canonical `nl-decision-v1` schema binding through the pinned action; trusted acceptance of one terminal `structured_output`; missing, multiple, invalid, and dishonest-native-success denial paths; the malformed `\`-before-backtick regression; bounded, tokenless, one-turn, no-tool repair; success-on-repair routing to a real answer; still-invalid repair denial with precise retryable projection; and static workflow proof that neither runtime branch can recurse into another repair attempt.
- `python tests/test_card_refresh.py` - the card-refresh change-detection, activity-reflection, refreshability-guard, and label-replace logic, pure functions, no network; also covers the `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 1 -> 2 retroactive triage-ref-qualification propagation and current version stamp: a render-version-behind card with a bare-ref cached `### Triage` section gets it qualified and stamped with the current `render_version` on the next refresh, a render-version-behind card with an older cached automated harness status line gets it labeled exactly once, a card already at the current version with already-qualified triage is a full no-op unless target activity advances, already-qualified refs/URLs/markdown links/non-ref `#` uses in the preserved section are left untouched, and qualification is driven by `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` + the card's own state repo rather than the item or model text.
- `python tests/test_target_observation.py` - pure versioned target-observation/action-receipt/projection-reference contracts, tamper-evident identities, approval invalidation effects, and current/pending/unknown projection planning.
- `python tests/test_option_b_architecture.py` - complete offline Option B contracts, projection golden, E2E-01 through E2E-07, denied-preclaim no-write/no-reorder, scheduled lifecycle/manual interleave, check-basis contradiction, class tri-state and exact card-1620 class-B fixture, timestamp-stable observation/context identity, repository-qualified closing-issue relations, reciprocal advisory context, card-1663's 237-candidate/3-relation regression, DecisionContext neutrality for authority (context status/content/`context_id` rotation neither grants nor denies; observation/head rotation still invalidates), the axi#84 14-changed-file `comparison_incomplete` admission, card-1676 hub-path fanout suppression with genuine non-hub relations surviving, strength-ordered candidate capping distinguishable from genuine comparison incompleteness, zero-spend re-admission of retired-context-rule assessments on ordinary refresh, compact title/full-URL-only model payloads, persisted-v1 context compatibility, advisory spend on bound incomplete v2 context, visible triage-suppression reasons, durable result recovery, owner-race serialization, legacy PR-write deferral, migration, and static workflow/token ownership.
- `python tests/test_decision_label_recovery.py` - production-composed decision-label projection-race recovery: exact authorized actor/card/repository/head/observation/context and post-erasure body-digest admission, complete fixed recoverable-label history, trusted projection erasure sequence, fixed-cap complete event/comment reads, one durable claim, post-claim and pre-action revalidation, and fail-closed owner body/checkbox edits, cross-label decisions, old, duplicate, replayed, superseded, explicitly removed, ambiguous, unsupported, malformed, or foreign cases.
- `python tests/test_target_reconcile_transaction.py` - production-composed timed fork-CI regression through `build_repo`, shared exact observer/check reduction/classifier, real reconcile/upsert/render, and the in-memory card boundary: same-scan terminal completion, still-pending current head, incomplete context list, force-push mismatch, persisted as-of identity, and fleet/card token restoration.
- `python tests/test_reconcile.py` - reconcile routing, target-activity state-only reflection, fixed-K adjacent scheduled-observation soft-close lifecycle/provenance, hard-close and stale-snapshot race safety, and stale-card self-healing, no network. Also covers the #551 approve/wait freeze: a `ci_wait_pr_numbers` PR-kind card is FROZEN (never consumed), its stale-head display is exact-reread and refreshed to pending or explicit unknown via `ci_wait_refresh_items` (anti-masquerade) without ever creating a card, the refresh is a no-op once the semantic projection is already current (no churn), and the intervening scheduled observation invalidates any prior absence streak before terminal checks release the freeze.
- `python tests/test_card_reuse.py` - deterministic end-to-end coverage through the actual reconcile, renderer/upsert, triage, decision, criteria, and trusted auto-merge indexing modules with an in-memory GitHub boundary: same/new-head and CI-to-PR reuse, strict provenance/actor/identity exclusions, legacy behavior, complete pagination, mutation races, partial failures, global lifecycle serialization, post-open uniqueness rollback, unchanged auto-merge duplicate denial, and the full two-absence waiting/re-entry lifecycle.
- `python tests/test_merge_conflict.py` - mergeability-independent readiness, source pushability policy routing, inert policy card rendering, and Phase 0 captain-facing manual-conflict copy, no network.
- `python tests/test_ci_autoapprove.py` - the shared `ci_safety` verdict, `pull_request_target` posture detection, and the auto-approve-vs-card routing plus scan-log observability in `build_repo`, all with the network-touching helpers stubbed.
  It covers the completed-context plus separate `action_required` masking regression, fail-closed pending-run discovery, the unchanged draft/fork/author boundaries, and approval of every verified same-workflow duplicate run.
  It also asserts that the risky-file HOLD still short-circuits before run listing or approval, the advisory security summary is attached only to a carded risky contributor PR, and the #551 approve/wait freeze remains limited to freshly approved or running CI.
- `python tests/test_ci_security_summary.py` - the advisory read-only CI-approval security summary (`ci_security_summary`), no network: the HOLD stays effective and the summary CANNOT act (every gh call is a read, `approve_ci` is never invoked); risky patterns are surfaced (`pull_request_target` + PR-head checkout, write permissions, `secrets: inherit`, referenced secret NAMES, unpinned third-party actions) while SHA-pinned actions and benign first-party workflows raise no flags; secret VALUES / verbatim file lines are never echoed and contributor values are sanitized against markdown breakout; it fails closed (unreadable/incomplete file lists and unreadable/unparseable files -> a manual-review note, never raises); composite `action.yml` files are analyzed; and the render side scopes `### Security review (advisory)` to ci-approval, frames it advisory/untrusted, keeps `security_summary` out of the state block, and never triggers a material refresh.
- `python tests/test_check_status.py` - direct, offline unit coverage for the `check_status()` aggregation invariant above, the rollup fail-closed backstop, genuinely green PRs, and card #543's disjoint axi test signals.
- `python tests/test_compliance_event_evidence.py` - offline contract coverage for opted-in current-body compliance evidence: exact workflow/run/CheckRun identity, complete bounded pagination and scan-local caching, monotonic latest-event selection independent of API/completion order, signed/unsigned/signed histories, conservative malformed/missing/cancelled/action-required evidence, legacy reduction isolation, a fresh G7 observation, and production-shaped PR #549 history without target mutation.
- `python tests/test_author_filter.py` - queue author filtering across PR review, CI approval, and issue triage, PR target `updatedAt` propagation for activity sorting, cleanup-closed PR removal before addressed-issue recomputation, plus open-issue/PR/closing-reference pagination guards, no network.
- `python tests/test_pending_contributor_cleanup.py` - offline coverage for deterministic, fail-open request-changes cleanup, including thresholds, proof and activity handling, timestamp recovery, silent legacy-rebase disarming, and the CI-approval clear-only path.
- `python tests/test_presentation_migration.py` - offline contract coverage for the bounded presentation-only exception documented in `docs/OPTION_B_CARD_PROJECTION.md`.
- `python tests/test_confirming_accept_copy.py` - confirming/inert recommendation framing vs Accept control presence (card #1721 / scan-5), no network: a confirming card with a current admitted recommendation keeps analysis and the inert decision copy, renders zero checkboxes, and never says "Tick **Accept recommendation**"; an ordinary published card with the same recommendation keeps the actionable Tick line and Accept checkbox; legacy contradictory bodies heal under `body_with_controls_aware_recommendation` / `body_with_reconcile_absence` and the read-only census proves the affected cohort reaches zero under the new renderer; clearing absence restores the actionable framing; `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 13 -> 14 is the migration owner for that copy fix (current version is later).
- `python tests/test_advisory_telemetry_consistency.py` - one coherent current triage state per card, no network: a failed primary plus advisory consumption plus a current admitted assessment renders analysis + Accept without the historical advisory-failure warning, while diagnostic `triage_primary_*` / `triage_consumption` state remains; the same telemetry without current authority stays explicitly unavailable with no Accept; corrected-authority copy still names the correction; ordinary projection refresh and the pure `body_with_coherent_advisory_telemetry` heal are idempotent and change no authority keys; the read-only census reports exact affected cards; `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 14 -> 15 is the migration owner.
- `python tests/test_canonical_recommendation.py` - the one canonical recommendation surface, no network and no model: the exact card-1746 production shape (advisory merge prose beside `output.schema_invalid`, `basis.missing_or_invalid`, G6/G3 UNMET) renders with no deterministic recommendation, no advisory action presented as a recommendation, both honest warnings preserved, and G6 evidence stating no valid agent recommendation was established; the unsupported `configured-tests` kind and the omitted `optin_default_off` each stay schema-invalid in isolation and no positive green-checks kind exists; the real PR-triage prompt enumerates exactly the three valid basis kinds on the shared pr-review branch, drops the bare `configured-tests basis` shorthand, routes a green-checks rationale to `other`, and marks `optin_default_off` always required in both automerge branches; plus the controls - an admitted merge recommendation renders exactly once, an admitted non-merge recommendation renders correctly with deterministic ref qualification, invalid/non-admitted/pre-triage/queued/no-result cards present none, issue and PR paths stay coherent, the deterministic producers are gone, and a render-version-stale v11 card migrates with byte-identical authority state, unchanged G6 rows, no fresh triage spend, and a no-op next scan.
- `python tests/test_auto_triage.py` - automatic PR-card AND issue-card triage: `auto_triage`/`auto_triage_issues` config defaults/overrides/independence, per-revision (`head_sha`/`updated_at`) cache and legacy-card backfill for both kinds, `activity_reflected_at` remaining non-material and being folded into queued writes, rendered section/no-mention behavior for both kinds, deterministic automated-status labeling for the narrow harness-line allowlist, reconcile/ingest dispatch gates including same-pass newly-created-card queueing by issue number, `triage.yml` token isolation including the issue-triage default-branch/no-head-verify path, and cross-repo ref qualification in the rendered `### Triage` section (`triage_section`/`body_with_triage_result` owner threading, the `triage.yml` prompt's qualification instruction, and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` reaching both `triage-apply`/`triage-fail` through the `env -i` sandbox), all offline. Also covers held cards for both kinds: `should_hold` gating parity with `should_auto_triage`, the placeholder render (no `opt:` markers, `pending-triage` label, `held` state key, `needs-decision` retained), `upsert_card` creating held only when triage would actually be queued, preserving held-ness while refresh eligibility still holds, publishing silently when refreshed eligibility turns off, a no-op refresh when unchanged, `update_card_triage` publishing on success AND on failure (fail-open), a stale-revision publish attempt being a no-op, unheld-card behavior staying byte-for-byte unchanged, reconcile self-healing a held card whose target closed, the dispatch-failure fail-open publish added to both `reconcile.py` and the `queue-triage` CLI, and the `triage-recover` fail-open safety net (`triage.yml`'s final `always()` recovery step wiring, and the CLI publishing a card genuinely stuck held+queued for its exact revision while being a no-op for a never-held card, an already-published card, or one queued for a different/superseded revision). Also covers the pass-by-reference `evidence` schema field (`normalize_triage` requires a non-empty string or non-empty string list, rejects missing/blank/malformed lists, and never leaks it into the rendered triage dict) and the `evidence_anchor_ok`/`_triage_evidence_verified` lazy/fabrication guard (genuine single-quoted, double-quoted, markdown-normalized, or conservative fallback target spans verify; fabricated or too-short spans are rejected; and an unreadable `target.txt` fails OPEN).
- `python tests/test_triage_budget.py` - fully offline automatic-triage spend-guard coverage for typed cap and ceiling configuration, strict non-material attempt records, cap exhaustion, trusted by-number daily-ledger creation and verification, UTC rollover, all fail-closed ledger failures, safe reservation leakage, the sealed dispatch boundary, workflow admission, shared concurrency, and the bounded two-call schema-repair amplification.
- `python tests/test_triage_context_allowance.py` - fully offline coverage for the separate verified base/VISION context-refresh allowance (audit F13): config defaults/boundaries/per-repo override/fail-closed classes, ingest normalization, the verified-movement detection matrix (legacy and first-VISION cards stay ordinary), strict `triage_context_allowance` record trust, the F13 acceptance scenario (two distinct context moves consume only the allowance while the ordinary count stays put), identical-identity repetition granting nothing, ordinary same-context replay retries staying on the original cap, allowance-zero disablement, issue-triage isolation, production-shaped v2 projection-card reservation/sealed-permit/idempotency boundaries, exhaustion emitting the bounded `context.deferred` diagnostic with no reservation or dispatch, G6 revalidation binding the refreshed base/VISION identity, and non-materiality plus same-revision preservation of the record.
- `python tests/test_triage_replay.py` - fully offline operator-only replay coverage for exact-number card/source reads, strict exact-revision and identity gates, claim tombstone verification, duplicate-only re-entry, terminal-error and absent-cache recovery, admission-duplicate card projection, fail-closed malformed/mismatch matrices, dry-run zero-write behavior, reviewable wave bounds, bounded dual-written triage result records, the two exact-cohort one-use evidence-array attempts resets, the code-defined one-use incident permit with the global cap pinned at 2, and the exact-selector-only advisory-cache recovery (production-shaped card #1746 acceptance with its zero-write auditable dry-run basis line, the card #1739 admitted-assessment control, ordinary successful caches, every independently refused predicate, generic/cohort discovery isolation, stale-revision refusal, and one-shot marker behavior). It also covers observation-drift targeted refresh: the exact-selector fallback for production-shaped card #1584, plus ordinary maintenance self-healing for complete current observations in the card #1819 class through the shared queue path, with incomplete, mismatched, locked, exhausted, already-current, and non-drift shapes remaining inert.
- `python tests/test_triage_prompt_size.py` - the PASS-BY-REFERENCE prompt architecture (card #517 E2BIG fix), offline static YAML inspection: the load-bearing invariant that neither `triage.yml` nor `deep-review.yml` inlines target content into the Claude `prompt.txt` block (no `cat target.txt`/`cat vision.md`/`gh pr diff`/`gh pr view`/`gh api` there), the prompt stays under a small fixed byte budget and far below `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` raw AND json-escaped, a worst-case synthetic PR (diffs up to 5 MB) never enters the prompt and the prompt size is FLAT regardless of diff size (with a demonstration that the OLD inline design WOULD exceed the limit), the prompt names `target.txt`/`target-src/` and directs Read/Grep/Glob, target.txt is always written and its diff/comments are bounded (deep-review's formerly-UNCAPPED diff is now capped), the untrusted-data framing survives when content is read from files, both the READONLY_TOKEN and no-token Claude steps consume the same by-reference prompt (no-token step is Read/Grep/Glob only), the `DIFF_COMPLETE` fail-closed-on-oversize / complete-on-disk semantics, and the `--target-file` anchor-check wiring.
- `python tests/test_nl_prompt_size.py` - offline guards for the bounded pass-by-reference NL prompt, tool isolation, explicit target truncation, and marker-keyed failure note.
- `python tests/test_triage_result_delivery.py` - card #556 delivered-result-drop regression, no network: a >256KiB Claude transcript that ends in a valid successful `result` event still delivers its verdict (`extract_result_to_file` returns a bounded compact file that flows through `extract_claude_result`->`parse_triage_json`->`normalize_triage`->the visible `### Triage` section with `triage_status:succeeded`), the CLI `extract-result` round-trips and exits non-zero when no result exists, and static YAML checks that `triage.yml`'s `triage-result` step extracts via `render_card.py extract-result` BEFORE the 262144 gate (so the size cap bounds only the retained `transcript.json` copy, never `result_path`) plus the audit that `deep-review.yml` never had a size-cap execution-file drop.
- `python tests/test_triage_schema_repair.py` - the context-equivalent single correction turn plus the evidence-quote byte policy, no network: correction eligibility (a DELIVERED candidate failing the bound schema, byte policy, or evidence anchoring is eligible - including advisory-normalizable candidates and anchor failures - while missing results and every infrastructure class refuse via the `CORRECTION_ELIGIBLE_ERROR_CODES` allowlist); exact binding refusals (stale revision, source-SHA mismatch, handoff identity, result/task hash, correction-of-a-correction); full spec parity of the built correction task with the original (selection/capabilities/tools/isolation/limits/inputs/output plus search scope), the `metadata.correction` bindings, the original-prompt-plus-candidate-plus-every-trusted-error correction prompt, and the `retry.repairTask: null` no-recursion policy; `decide_triage_apply` routing (`success`/`repaired`/`advisory`/`repair-failed`/`no-result`, bridge error codes barring the authority path, corrected results validated on their own with no basis restore); authority semantics (valid primary and valid corrected results keep authority with `triage_consumption` `primary`/`corrected`, a failed correction leaves the original explicitly advisory-only with no admission/Accept/recommendation/auto-merge verdict); the byte-policy boundaries (1024/1025/2048 valid, 2049 invalid, multibyte char/byte divergence, the exact 253-byte card #1693 production quote pinned valid, the schema 2048-char bound as secondary defense, and the 1024-byte prompt rule in every branch); `triage_schema_reason` staying purely structural; the NON-MATERIAL telemetry keys; the legacy no-tool planner/prompt helpers kept only for the disabled codex evidence branch; the `triage-apply --repair-execution-file` CLI end-to-end with mocked card I/O; and static `triage.yml` wiring (handoff download -> bind-verified primary result -> `correction-eligible` -> claim-gated `build-correction-task` -> `claude-model-call` with the original search scope, the unchanged `triage.schema-repair` claim identity, and the consume job passing `--primary-error-code`/`--repair-error-code`).
- `python tests/test_deep_review.py` - the always-on/code-grounded deep-review and Investigate wiring: render options, the removed enable flag, the token-absent note, the `persist-credentials: false` checkout plus read-only tool isolation, the narrow `allowed_bots`, the optional READONLY_TOKEN-gated `wheelhouse-search` wiring, normalized `AgentResult` verdict capture, issue-only manual dispatch, the handler's immutable-input `workflow_dispatch` trigger, and the "Post the verdict" step's automated-status labeling plus `qualify_issue_refs` call (with the deterministic `TARGET_REPO`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` inputs) running before the `gh issue comment` post, plus the prompt's qualification instruction, all by inspecting the scripts/YAML, no network.
- `python tests/test_workflow_lint.py` - a regression guard that scans every `.github/workflows/*.yml` `run:` step for a `gh api` invocation combining `--slurp` with `--jq` (mutually exclusive in the installed `gh` CLI - `gh api --slurp` yields an array of per-page arrays and must instead be piped into a standalone `jq`), no network.
- `python tests/test_qualify_refs.py` - direct unit tests for `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs` (bare `#N` -> `owner/repo#N`, already-qualified/URL/markdown-link/`GH-123`/`#123abc` left untouched, multiple refs in one string, `None`/empty safety, idempotency, and that qualification is driven by the caller-supplied slug rather than any repo the text itself names), no network.
- `python tests/test_scan_reliability.py` - the card #411 scan reliability and correctness hardening: GraphQL retry/backoff, paginated scans, health ledger, and complete-scan worklist behavior, no network.
- `python tests/test_config_schema.py` - structural load test that `wheelhouse_core.load_config()` accepts the checked-in `wheelhouse.config.yml`: every `repos:` entry is well-formed (name is trimmed and matches its key; `compliance_check` is null or a trimmed non-empty string; `compliance_evidence`, when present, matches its exact supported schema; `test_check_patterns` is a list of trimmed non-empty strings; `merge_method` is unset or squash|merge|rebase) and repo names are case-insensitively unique. Deliberately pins no repo names or fleet size, so it keeps guarding the file as the fleet grows/shrinks, no network.
- `python tests/test_auto_merge_v1.py` - scan-time auto-merge (V1), no network and no target-repo writes: the config + exclusion helpers (`_auto_merge_enabled` default-off/overrides, `_auto_merge_exclusions` covering every category incl. VISION.md self-authorization); the pure `verdict_eligible` gate (A/B/C eligibility, class-B restoration and semantic contradiction admission, class-C opt-in/default-off, malformed/stale/absent verdicts, fail-closed defaults) plus `normalize_automerge_verdict` parsing/coercion; the blast-radius caps at the exact 20-file and 1000-line boundaries; every deterministic gate G0-G6 walked through PASS and HOLD via representative live-card fixtures in `act_on_scan`; the G7 live head + merge-state + same-closing-issue overlap re-check immediately before acting (including scan-clear/act-ambiguous and unreadable evidence); the `wheelhouse:no-auto-merge` escape hatch and global/per-repo kill switches; the ok:false/truncated/indeterminate freeze; base-branch-ONLY VISION.md reads (contents API, no `?ref`); the durable ledger (parse/append/render/cap) + audit comment + `record` CLI resolving the card and appending the ledger (best-effort/no-op paths); the `do_merge` race/error outcomes; the required same-closing-issue ambiguity hold; and the DELIBERATE ABSENCE of an open-PR same-file overlap gate and any per-contributor/per-scan rate cap; the claim-time author-duality normalization (real `get_card`-shaped `{"login": "app/github-actions"}` fixtures normalize and are trusted, `github-actions[bot]` stays trusted, and a human login / a different `app/*` slug / bare `github-actions` / lookalikes all stay fail-closed rejected); plus offline YAML wiring checks (FLEET preclaim/act steps, default-token claim/record steps, preclaim->claim->validate->act->record->reconcile order, the criteria handoff, and the triage.yml base-VISION verdict prompt).
- `python tests/test_automerge_card_ui.py` - authoritative auto-merge criterion UI, no network: every stable row's positive and fail-closed negative state, owner/bot/history distinctions, workflow/security exclusions, dirty/unknown mergeability and checks, verdict freshness and A/B/C details, blast limits, held/claimed card state, the real axi#96 shape through evaluator and renderer, old-card fallback, criterion-only refresh, and proof that persisted display rows cannot grant eligibility.
- `python tests/test_automerge_workflow_hold.py` - durable history-only workflow manual-merge hold, no network: the real two-hour claim/validate/act/record/reconcile lifecycle, structured final-gate evidence, same-head no-reclaim behavior, G7 `UNMET` presentation, clean and still-dirty new heads, G2 net-diff separation, unreadable/incomplete fail-closed paths, malformed/stale state, persistence recovery, same-head maintenance and trusted reuse, immediate hard close, and default-card-token isolation.
YAML-parse `.github/workflows/*.yml` plus `wheelhouse.config.yml` plus `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`.
Run `actionlint` if available.
The live LLM paths (auto triage, deep-review, nl_decisions) can only be exercised end-to-end in CI with the token set and, for nl_decisions, the flag on.
Secrets the maintainer must add for the current production selection: `FLEET_TOKEN` always, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for auto triage/deep-review and/or nl_decisions, and optionally `READONLY_TOKEN` public-read only for auto triage, nl_decisions, and deep-review search.
Do not add a Codex credential under the current Pro plus public-repository topology; `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md` owns the activation prerequisites.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
