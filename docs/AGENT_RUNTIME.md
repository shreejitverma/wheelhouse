# Wheelhouse agent runtime

Wheelhouse has one versioned contract for every agent-assisted task.
The contract covers automatic PR and issue triage with and without search, the context-equivalent triage correction turn, natural-language schema repair, deep review with and without search, and natural-language decision mapping with and without search.

Claude is the production primary adapter.
The two schema-repair actions resolve to the exact-pin direct Claude CLI profile through the guarded production activation.
The other eight actions remain on the exact pinned Claude Action implementation.
In production only `nl-decision.schema-repair` still builds a schema-repair task: the triage correction turn is a rebuild of the ORIGINAL triage AgentTask (same action, inputs, tools, and limits) under the unchanged `triage.schema-repair` claim identity, so `triage.schema-repair` remains configured and deployable without being selected by the claude lane.
The action path remains present and deployable as the schema-repair rollback target.
Codex CLI app-server remains implemented and tested only as disabled non-target adapter evidence because public GitHub Actions cannot securely authenticate the captain's ChatGPT Pro subscription noninteractively.
Fallback is disabled, so no provider failure invokes a different adapter automatically.

## Current operating state

The checked-in state is intentionally:

- `primary_profile: claude-action-current-pinned`
- `target: claude`
- `fallback: none`
- every action `target: claude`
- every base action profile `claude-action-current-pinned`
- `production_activation` maps only `triage.schema-repair` and `nl-decision.schema-repair` to `claude-cli-pinned`
- `temporary_rollback_profile: null`; setting it to `claude-action-current-pinned` restores both repair actions for an explicit durable replay
- `codex-app-server` recorded only under `disabled_adapters`

This is not selected by secret presence.
Provider environment overrides are rejected.
The current selection cannot target Codex or reach its workflow installation branches.

Both Claude production lanes keep the immutable model identifier, bounded turns, token boundaries, and output behavior.
Trusted parent jobs construct and validate an immutable `AgentTask`, upload a bounded content-addressed handoff with signed hidden paths preserved, and invoke `claude-model.yml` through a local reusable-workflow job.
GitHub resolves that local reusable workflow from the caller's commit, and every caller also passes its exact `github.sha` as the expected source revision.
That separate workflow has only `actions: read` and `contents: read`, receives no `FLEET_TOKEN`, and cannot write cards or target repositories.
Before task construction, every spend-capable event creates a durable default-token claim whose key binds the action, target, decision card, exact target revision, and the trigger identity required for deep review and natural-language decisions.
An eligible natural-language schema repair uses a distinct durable claim bound to the same authorized comment event, so a rerun cannot spend another repair turn. Its visible admission copy identifies the schema-repair phase while the hidden marker preserves the separate repair identity and idempotency key.
The triage correction turn claims the same distinct `triage.schema-repair` identity (action plus exact target revision) before spend, while its AgentTask carries the ORIGINAL triage action for exact capability parity plus a `metadata.correction` block binding the original task hash, execution id, and rejected `valueSha256`.
Schema-repair actions are structurally ineligible to create another repair task, and a correction task declares `retry.repairTask: null`, carries `metadata.correction`, and is refused as a correction source, so no correction can recurse.
Duplicate delivery exits before task construction, and the claim key becomes the AgentTask `idempotencyKey`, so task, result, and terminal event evidence remain bound to the admitted event without retaining prompt or target content in lifecycle records.
An operator-approved exact-revision auto-triage replay first tombstones only the matching primary-triage claim marker and directly verifies that admission can no longer discover it.
The original claim comment remains as a bounded superseded audit record, while schema-repair, deep-review, and natural-language claim identities are outside the supersede operation.
If that tombstone cannot be written and verified, replay refuses the card before queueing or reservation.
After a successful supersede write, replay also polls the same `render_card.get_card` path the projection CAS uses until two consecutive full snapshots containing that exact tombstone (comment id + superseded marker) match, so GitHub read-after-write lag cannot make consecutive card snapshots disagree about the replay's own comment edit.
Visibility timeout or malformed/ambiguous tombstone evidence pauses the wave with the existing fail-closed "could not be queued" path and performs no queue or budget reservation; an already-absent claim needs no visibility wait.
The projection writer's `updated_at` and comments-digest checks stay strict - this poll only orders the self-write before queueing.
The only replay marker that can re-enter its once guard is the proven `admission.duplicate`-only cohort: its terminal primary claim and any claim-keyed result record must both predate the replay marker, proving denial before task construction.
That exception removes only the duplicate queued reservation from the per-revision attempt count and replay-marker guard; the daily ledger reservation and all other guards remain intact.
An admission duplicate for an exact queued revision is projected as a terminal card error without clearing the queue cache key, making the denial visible without enabling an hourly retry loop.
Automatic triage also dual-writes one bounded claim-keyed `wheelhouse-triage-record` hidden comment for each admitted attempt, containing only version, event key, revision, structural status, and structural consumer code.
Normal triage card consumers do not read that migration record, but replay may read it only as bounded duplicate-only evidence.
Automatic triage also reserves from the closed UTC daily budget ledger before its verified queued-card checkpoint.
The default `triage_daily_ceiling` is 1200 reservations per UTC day, and each reservation can reach at most one primary call plus one bounded correction call, for a 2400-model-call daily worst case; the correction call runs at the original action's own budget because it is the same task re-run with the rejected candidate and trusted errors appended.
The finite default lets approved replay waves complete without cost throttling while preserving a hard runaway-containment bound.
The per-card `triage_attempt_cap_per_revision` defaults to two queued attempts for one card-kind source revision.
Malformed cap configuration fails closed to one, while malformed ceiling or ledger state fails closed to zero new reservations.
Deep-review and natural-language decision events remain outside this automatic-triage ceiling because each requires a deliberate owner action and its own durable claim.
The model job verifies the complete handoff before hydrating a fresh workspace and initializes a local repository without a remote or network fetch.
The action lane applies its exact action tool allowlist and leaves only a bounded transcript plus observed enforcement record for its finalizer.
That finalizer requires exactly one successful result event and at least one preceding `system/init.model` identity matching the immutable requested model. A result may be followed by non-result telemetry, and repeated init evidence is accepted only when every observed model identity agrees. Missing or conflicting identity evidence, model substitution, duplicate results, error subtypes, and unsuccessful results still fail closed. Missing, mistyped, or out-of-range `duration_ms` is non-authoritative telemetry: an otherwise valid result is retained with zero normalized duration and a bounded `proof.transcriptVariance` diagnostic. Accepted trailing rows and repeated agreeing init evidence receive the same content-free diagnostic so protocol variance remains visible.
The direct repair lane pins the model job to `ubuntu-24.04`, installs and verifies Bubblewrap `0.9.0-1ubuntu0.1`, exercises a real namespace before provider admission, verifies Claude CLI `2.1.215` against the platform digest in `runtime.lock.json`, binds the OAuth credential through one mode-0600 file, and launches the existing supervisor and worker inside the Bubblewrap provider-only sandbox. Bubblewrap is launched through the runner's passwordless `sudo` solely because Ubuntu 24.04 denies unprivileged loopback setup in a new network namespace; it clears the environment and drops all worker capabilities before executing the model process. The root-mapped worker receives only a write-only output mount; after exit, the trusted supervisor restores ownership only on regular expected result and diagnostic files before validating them.
Sandbox-prerequisite failure is recorded separately from Claude download or digest failure, and both remain pre-spend with zero provider requests.
The action lane revalidates the signed target inputs after invocation and accepts success only when the post-action observation is non-null and exactly matches the pre-action observation for `target.txt`, `target-src/`, and `repository-provenance.json`.
Declared outputs, `.git/**`, `vision.md`, and unrelated workspace scratch are outside that signed-input immutability proof; unexpected scratch can be diagnostic, but it does not by itself invalidate the read-only target-input proof.
The reusable model workflow validates its observed `GITHUB_SHA` against the expected caller commit before hydration or provider admission.
Its separately permissioned finalizer verifies the handoff again, binds the observed source revision into the enforcement proof, and atomically emits `AgentResult` plus content-free events as a bounded artifact for the trusted consumer.
Triage and schema-repair claims record `consumer-committed` only after the trusted card projection reports an actual exact-revision update or held-card recovery; a successful no-op or stale projection remains `consumer-rejected`.
Every task limit carries provider-neutral enforcement evidence as `externally-enforced`, `adapter-enforced`, or `unavailable`, and an unavailable value is explicitly `null`.
Claude records the exact end-to-end hard deadline as unavailable because GitHub can delay a reusable job.
The obsolete API dispatch deadline is unavailable because the model job is part of the caller's workflow graph, while the child-job execution timeout remains externally enforced.
Trusted artifact, transcript, event, and final-output bounds remain explicit.
The model workflow uploads a content-free `spendStarted: true` checkpoint immediately before either invocation lane, so cancellation or a harness crash cannot downgrade a possibly spent attempt.
The Claude Action bridge profile does not claim the disabled Codex worker's network namespace, capability dropping, no-new-privileges, environment denial, or host-home denial.
Its proof level is `github-readonly-artifact-bridge-v1`, distinct from `sandboxed-adapter-worker-v1` used by adapters actually launched through the stronger worker boundary.
The action lane records the pinned action source commit and a checked-out action metadata digest when the runner exposes it; a successful direct repair records its verified Claude executable version and digest instead.

## Direct Claude schema-repair production profile

`agent_runtime/adapters/claude.py` implements the minimum direct Claude CLI boundary used by both schema-repair actions.
It accepts only the `anthropic-subscription` profile and a private file handoff for the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` process binding, rejects ambient API, cloud, GitHub, alternate-provider, and fallback configuration, and verifies one regular executable against the exact `2.1.215` platform digest before spend.
The runtime lock records the official release commit, immutable download URLs, Linux x64 and arm64 plus Darwin arm64 digests, and a checked protocol fixture digest.

The adapter validates the bound action schema against the small pinned-CLI subset before exposing `output.structured: native-schema`.
It compiles one shell-free argv, keeps the prompt on standard input, and requires exactly one matching `system/init.model` plus one final successful `structured_output` result from a bounded UTF-8 stream.
Its cancellation primitive is `SIGTERM` to the Claude process group, with the runtime retaining grace and hard-kill ownership.
The trusted core still owns the sandbox, provider proxy, deadlines, content-addressed handoff, independent schema and evidence validation, result binding, events, retention, and secret scanning.

The direct schema-repair profile intentionally has an empty tool inventory, one turn, no shell, and no fallback model.
Successful results must contain terminal native `structured_output`; the trusted core revalidates it and records `native-schema` plus `json-schema` validation, exact observed model, execution profile, sandbox implementation, and credential isolation in `AgentResult`.
`verify_result_binding` rejects any result whose execution profile differs from its admitted task.
The pinned action, `claude_bridge.py`, their workflow steps, and their tests remain present for the rollback window.
After rollback, replay is explicit through the existing marker-versioned durable triage replay path; automatic hourly cache retry remains disabled.
Before another profile is promoted, production observation uses the durable result and stage records for at least 20 successful or expected-failure executions over at least seven days.

## Operator replay exact-card selector

The supported replay owner remains an owner-started `scan-backstop.yml` `workflow_dispatch` with a non-empty validated `replay_wave`. Scheduled runs cannot reach replay, and the default empty `replay_exact_cards` input preserves the legacy sorted-prefix behavior.

Any raw non-empty `replay_exact_cards` input puts that workflow run into replay-only posture before the selector is validated. Checkout, runtime setup, and the exact replay owner may run, but open-card listing, fleet scan, stale-contributor maintenance, auto-approval, all auto-merge phases, queue reconcile, generic auto-triage queueing, card refresh/activity reflection/closure, and scan-health bookkeeping are skipped. Malformed selectors, a missing or invalid wave, count/limit mismatch, and incompatible reset input therefore fail in the replay owner without falling through to routine maintenance. A write-enabled exact run can mutate only through the existing exact replay path. An exact dry-run performs only its exact-card/source planning reads and reports zero writes. Leaving `replay_exact_cards` empty preserves scheduled maintenance, ordinary manual maintenance, legacy generic replay, and generic replay dry-run behavior except for the reserved card 1585 incident wave below, which remains replay-only and fails closed without its exact selector.

For a reviewed non-prefix cohort, set `replay_exact_cards` to the versioned contract `v1:N[,N...]`. Each `N` is a positive decimal card number from 1 through 9,007,199,254,740,991 without leading zeroes. The selector accepts at most 25 unique numbers, canonicalizes them into ascending order, rejects whitespace, empty elements, ranges, wildcards, duplicates, and trailing data, and requires `replay_limit` to equal the selector count. It cannot be combined with `replay_attempts_reset_cards`.

For example, plan six exact cards with zero writes:

```bash
gh-axi workflow run scan-backstop.yml \
  --repo OWNER/wheelhouse \
  --ref main \
  --field replay_wave=reviewed-wave \
  --field replay_limit=6 \
  --field replay_exact_cards='v1:1483,1584,1585,1586,1594,1598' \
  --field replay_dry_run=true
```

When this selector is present, the candidate listing is not used for discovery. Every requested card and source is still read by exact number and must pass the existing trusted identity, exact-revision, pure-card, applicable cache-eligibility, attempt-cap, replay-marker, claim, daily-budget, sealed-permit, and idempotency checks. Selection grants no admission or authority. The sole code-defined exception to the normal attempt cap is the separately bound, one-use card 1585 incident permit below.

The planner reports the canonical selector and one `exact-selector/v1 admitted` line per card containing its revision. Dry-run and write-enabled modes use that same planner. If any requested card is missing, ineligible, changed during the full second-read preflight, already recovered, or the complete cohort exceeds remaining daily budget, the wave fails before writes and no generic candidate is substituted. After mutation starts, an unavoidable later GitHub race or write failure stops the wave immediately; already queued cards remain independently safe, no other card is substituted, and the operator must freeze and dry-run an explicit remaining cohort before another write-enabled dispatch.

### Advisory-cache recovery for a failed primary

The ordinary replay cache contract is unchanged: a proven current `triage_status: error` cache is cleared, a genuinely absent cache is marked, a proven duplicate-only cohort may re-enter, and `queued` or ordinary `succeeded` caches are refused as `triage-cache-not-terminal-error`.

The exact-card selector adds exactly one narrow recovery class, proven by cards #1746 and #1704: a `succeeded` cache whose trusted primary result FAILED, whose delivered candidate was consumed only as advisory prose, and which therefore holds no admitted assessment and no authority-bearing recommendation. Such a card cannot heal at its current revision - the cache is fresh, so scheduled scans no-op, and the zero-spend readmission covers only retired context denials.

Admission requires every one of these trusted stored facts on a pure `needs-decision` pr-review card at its exact current revision: `triage_primary_status: failed` with a bounded non-empty `triage_primary_error_code`, `triage_consumption: advisory`, a well-formed non-`admitted` `assessment_admission` record (matching the persisted assessment's own admission when one exists), no current admitted assessment, no `triage_recommendation`, and no available Accept shortcut. Anything missing, malformed, contradictory, legacy-ambiguous, or only partially matching refuses with a precise `advisory-recovery-*` reason: `kind-unsupported`, `cache-unproven`, `primary-not-failed`, `consumption-not-advisory`, `admission-unproven`, or `authority-present`. A schema-invalid primary whose advisory result nevertheless produced a current admitted assessment (card #1739) is refused as `advisory-recovery-authority-present`; `output.schema_invalid` alone never makes a cache replayable.

This is an operator route, not automatic healing. Generic prefix discovery, scheduled reconcile, same-revision refresh, and the attempt-reset cohorts can never select the class - only a card named in `replay_exact_cards`. Selection grants no authority: the old advisory prose and delivered candidate are discarded, never promoted. An admitted replay plan clears its dead cache plus its primary/consumption telemetry, denied admission record, and stale verdict together with the queued write, then requests one ordinary attempt through the same exact-revision, freshness, attempt-cap, daily-budget, claim-tombstone, queued-checkpoint, and sealed-dispatch path every other replay uses. Its version 1 marker records `cleared: advisory`, so the same card and revision cannot be replayed again.

Dry-run remains zero-write and prints the admitted plan plus an `advisory-recovery basis:` line naming the proven facts, so the eligibility decision is auditable before any write-enabled dispatch:

```bash
gh-axi workflow run scan-backstop.yml \
  --repo OWNER/wheelhouse \
  --ref main \
  --field replay_wave=advisory-cache-recovery \
  --field replay_limit=1 \
  --field replay_exact_cards='v1:1746' \
  --field replay_dry_run=true
```

### Observation-drift targeted refresh for a stale admitted assessment

Cards #1584 and #1819 establish one narrow recovery class: a `succeeded` cache that still carries a persisted ADMITTED assessment whose observation binding drifted on an UNCHANGED head. A same-revision projection refresh rotates the card's `review_observation` whenever the scan observes new facts for the same head, while the triage cache (`triaged_sha`) and same-revision triage preservation are head-bound. The renderer's authority predicate is observation-bound, so Accept and G6 stay off after the rotation, and the residual authority makes the advisory class above refuse as `advisory-recovery-authority-present` (or a non-admitted stored assessment as `advisory-recovery-admission-unproven`).

Admission requires every one of these trusted stored facts on a pure `needs-decision` pr-review card at its exact current revision: no current admitted assessment under the renderer's one owning predicate, a well-formed persisted assessment whose own admission is `admitted`, the assessment's repo and number equal to the card target, the current observation's owner/repo/number equal to the assessment target and its repo/number equal to the card target, the assessment and observation heads equal to the card's current head and to the selected revision, a well-formed current review observation, and an assessment observation id that differs from the current observation id. Anything missing, malformed, contradictory, or only partially matching refuses with a precise `drift-refresh-*` reason (`kind-unsupported`, `cache-unproven`, `assessment-current`, `assessment-not-admitted`, `target-mismatch`, `head-mismatch`, `observation-unproven`, or `not-observation-drift`) and the original advisory refusal is preserved verbatim. A target disagreement specifically refuses as `drift-refresh-target-mismatch`. A card whose assessment is already current - the ordinary healthy shape - refuses as `drift-refresh-assessment-current`; a non-current assessment whose observation did NOT drift (for example a malformed decision context) refuses as `drift-refresh-not-observation-drift`, because those shapes have their own owners.

Ordinary trusted maintenance now heals this class automatically only when the current ReviewObservation is complete, the scan item and card carry that exact observation and current head/target identity, and the card is a pure refreshable PR-review card. The shared drift predicate makes the head-keyed cache stale, then the existing queue checkpoint clears the stale assessment, assessment result/admission records, residual recommendation, stale verdict, and primary/consumption telemetry before reserving one ordinary per-head attempt and one daily-ceiling unit. Incomplete or malformed observations, mismatched or stale snapshots, locked cards, already-current assessments, non-drift shapes, and exhausted attempts remain inert. A raced second pass sees the queued cache and grants no additional spend. The fresh attempt binds the current observation through normal admission; the old assessment is never rebound.

The exact-card selector remains an operator fallback for this same proven class. Generic prefix discovery and attempt-reset cohorts cannot select it; only a card named in `replay_exact_cards` can enter that route. Selection grants no authority. In addition to clearing the same residue and using the same reservation, queued checkpoint, and sealed dispatch, an admitted operator plan writes a version 1 replay marker recording `cleared: observation-drift`, so the same card and revision cannot be replayed again through that route. The attempt cap is preserved, never reset. Both paths therefore consume exactly one of the revision's remaining ordinary attempts, and a fresh result either re-admits an assessment bound to the current observation or ends in an explicit unavailable state with no residual misleading recommendation.

Dry-run remains zero-write, card-bound, and idempotent. It prints the admitted plan, an `observation-drift basis:` line naming the proven facts (assessment admission, head currency, the two observation ids, residual-recommendation presence, and the attempt count), and an explicit enumeration of every planned card mutation and the model spend (one triage attempt of at most two model calls, one daily-ledger reservation, one claim tombstone, dispatch only through the existing sealed permit):

```bash
gh-axi workflow run scan-backstop.yml \
  --repo OWNER/wheelhouse \
  --ref main \
  --field replay_wave=observation-drift-refresh \
  --field replay_limit=1 \
  --field replay_exact_cards='v1:1584' \
  --field replay_dry_run=true
```

### One-use card 1585 incident permit

`card-1585-anchor-fix-r3-final` is a code-defined, one-use permit for card 1585 only. It is not a general reset. It requires `replay_exact_cards='v1:1585'`, limit 1, the owner actor, the search action and its exact event key, the existing 2/2 attempt record, reviewed prior replay marker, exact terminal claim and result records, and the landed escaped-quote anchor behavior. Every planning and mutation reread rebuilds the approved source-review binding: `kunchenguid/no-mistakes#547` at head `0f29152c44b808064f9a2a2621c9bde6456f6262`, base `3d4691aedba97d9f877c073e3e652a8fde69d574`, target-facts digest `c8308310c07e85d840ea41785f78786a04d181bcf25c1b2ae6dbe4db278f6ea9`, immutable title/body/update snapshot digest `a0dd38be93e516c4bd3c376993d2dc3eee89f6e90638f63c55017aac808661a6` at `2026-07-23T04:56:49Z`, default-branch VISION blob `08077197b28d5f6b5b74b405d4617f066f620e33`, and VISION content digest `be04f798e4e616390c87a7fd21db7a3f656a4a7077b897c6a8aeb5cb49721b43`. Any mismatch stops before reservation.

The permit first writes and verifies its version 3 replay marker while leaving the terminal 2/2 cache scheduler-inert. A marker-write failure leaves the prior claim and permit retryable. Once verified, the marker permanently consumes the permit; claim tombstoning, ordinary budget reservation, the atomic queued checkpoint, or sealed dispatch may proceed, and any later failure remains consumed and cannot be picked up by scheduled reconciliation. The replay-owned queued checkpoint alone clears the terminal cache and makes one counter slot available without changing the effective cap of 2. Other cards, revisions, waves, selectors, reset inputs, and ordinary replay remain under the existing cap. The incident wave itself enters replay-only workflow posture before selector validation, as does any non-empty exact selector, so a missing or malformed incident selector still runs no scan, reconciliation, auto-merge, target action, or ordinary maintenance.

First run the exact zero-write plan:

```bash
gh-axi workflow run scan-backstop.yml \
  --repo OWNER/wheelhouse \
  --ref main \
  --field replay_wave=card-1585-anchor-fix-r3-final \
  --field replay_limit=1 \
  --field replay_exact_cards='v1:1585' \
  --field replay_dry_run=true
```

Only after that run is green and its admitted binding exactly matches the values above, consume the permit once with the identical invocation except for `replay_dry_run=false`:

```bash
gh-axi workflow run scan-backstop.yml \
  --repo OWNER/wheelhouse \
  --ref main \
  --field replay_wave=card-1585-anchor-fix-r3-final \
  --field replay_limit=1 \
  --field replay_exact_cards='v1:1585' \
  --field replay_dry_run=false
```

## Disabled and investigated adapters

The authentication audit found no officially supported secure noninteractive way to use the current ChatGPT Pro subscription from this public GitHub Actions repository.

Do not add any of these to target the disabled Codex adapter:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `CODEX_API_KEY`
- `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- a copied `auth.json` blob

The official Codex GitHub Action uses OpenAI Platform API-key billing.
That is not ChatGPT subscription authentication and is forbidden unless the captain separately changes the billing decision.

Managed `auth.json` is officially documented only for trusted private CI.
It is forbidden by the official guidance for public or open-source repositories.
It contains refreshable OAuth material and requires one serialized consumer plus secure mutable persistence of every refreshed replacement.
A repository secret cannot safely implement that write-back lifecycle.

The runtime's disabled Codex adapter does not accept ambient Codex credentials, and no public workflow creates a credential handoff.
OpenCode with Z.AI Coding Plan is a deferred disabled candidate only.
No purchase decision, credential request, provider call, workflow target, or OpenCode adapter is authorized in this phase.
Provider-specific OpenCode or Z.AI policy must not enter runtime core schemas, lifecycle, tools, or consumers.
The provider-neutral adapter interface remains the only future seam.

## Runtime boundary

Trusted Wheelhouse steps continue to authorize events, fetch immutable target inputs, bind revisions, and perform every GitHub mutation.
The selected harness runs in a distinct disposable GitHub Actions job whose token permissions are read-only and whose workspace is hydrated only from the verified task handoff.

The Claude Action compatibility boundary receives only:

- bounded prompt and input files represented by the immutable task
- the exact action-specific tool allowlist
- the selected Claude subscription credential
- the optional read-only search credential on search-enabled paths
- one fresh workspace with read-only task inputs and bounded action output

The Claude model subprocess never receives `FLEET_TOKEN` or another GitHub credential with write or acting authority.
The action no-search path receives only the model job's downscoped default token because the pinned action requires a GitHub token input.
Search-enabled action paths may receive only the optional `READONLY_TOKEN` and the narrow `wheelhouse-search` command.
For the exact `nl-decision.search` and `triage.pr.search` actions only, that command also exposes the bounded anonymous `public_clone` request operation. It accepts a complete public HTTPS Git URL plus an optional safe ref, retains one data-only shallow clone under `RUNNER_TEMP` for Read/Grep/Glob, and removes it in an `always()` cleanup step. Initial PR triage explicitly distinguishes local-only VISION criteria from criteria that require external source inspection. External-source-positive verdicts require matching exact-file SHA-256 observations and clone provenance derived by a trusted post-turn verification step that re-clones and independently observes successful claims. Failed claims are not cloned again: trusted code re-validates their source values and emits a fixed failure token. The model's turn attempts no privilege escalation, and an unreproducible successful claim becomes a failure record. The `triage.pr.search` declaration uses the narrowly scoped `Bash(wheelhouse-search:*)` form because the exact Bash matcher does not reliably admit the model's invocation; the installed shim still accepts only its bare, argument-less invocation and rejects every argument before handling a request. Other search actions retain the exact declaration. Cloned and package execution remain forbidden.
Trusted card writes and target operations remain outside the model subprocess.

The disabled Codex adapter keeps `READONLY_TOKEN` in a trusted host broker.
Its model can call `github.search.readonly`, but it receives only the bounded broker result and never receives the token or a shell.

Codex built-in shell, web search, apps, connectors, memories, plugins, hooks, and multi-agent features are disabled.
The app-server receives only task-declared dynamic tools.
Unregistered app-server requests are denied.

The disabled Codex worker network runs through a Unix-socket CONNECT proxy with an auth-profile endpoint allowlist.
Its sandbox has a separate network namespace and no direct network route.
Its tool network is either absent or the read-only broker socket.

## Contract and pins

The public contract version is `wheelhouse.agent-runtime/v1alpha1`.
The public documents are:

- `AgentTask`
- monotonic NDJSON `AgentEvent`
- atomic `AgentResult`

The schemas live under `agent_runtime/schemas/`.
Unknown fields are rejected.
Canonical contract and proof hashes use deterministic JSON plus SHA-256.
The terminal event's `resultSha256` uses the explicit `agent-result-without-artifacts/v1` projection so the normalized-event artifact cannot create a cyclic or order-dependent digest.

Codex is pinned to CLI `0.144.0`, source commit `767822446c7a594caa19609ca435281a9ec67e0d`, npm package integrity, architecture-specific Linux executable-package integrity, and vendored app-server schema digests.
The direct Claude CLI adapter is pinned separately to CLI `2.1.215`, release commit `316ce99628e89900bf0b1328fed3b8fec0c0c92d`, official platform URLs and SHA-256 digests, and its bounded stream-JSON fixture digest.
The model-free `Agent Runtime canary` job runs the same signed installer script on `ubuntu-24.04`, including the exact package preflight, a minimal Bubblewrap namespace command, binary download, digest check, and `--version` probe without any model credential.
Run `python scripts/agent_runtime.py verify-pins` to verify the protocol files.
Offline evidence verifies the exact wrapper and selected Linux executable tarballs against the committed SHA-512 integrity pins.
Current production selection cannot reach the disabled Codex installation branches in workflows.

The app-server is driven over stdio JSONL.
Human terminal output is never scraped.
The worker performs `initialize`, `account/read` with `refreshToken:false`, model listing, provider capability reading, quota reading when available, `thread/start`, `turn/start`, and `turn/interrupt`.

The disabled Codex worker requires observed account type `chatgpt`.
Its offline adapter evidence also requires an eligible Business or Enterprise plan for the access-token mechanism.
Its generated test configuration forces `chatgpt` login and an explicitly supplied workspace ID.
Ambient `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` are rejected before the worker starts.
An undeclared provider, model reroute, model mismatch, or effort mismatch fails closed.

## Size budgets

`agent_runtime/size_budget.py` is the one authoritative owner of every byte
bound that shapes a model interaction; no consumer carries its own copy of a
size constant.
The per-action table records the bound action schema, the canonical
final-byte cap (`maxFinalBytes`), and the repair-candidate retention bound;
the module also owns the prompt budgets (`MAX_ARG_STRLEN`-derived env budget
and the compiled stdin-artifact cap), the transcript and result-artifact read
bounds, the contract ceiling for `maxFinalBytes` / `delivered.bytes` /
`final.bytes`, and the NL trusted-history inline budget.
`tests/test_size_budget.py` holds the property tests that keep the table
coherent.

The invariants, all test-enforced:

- Every action's `maxFinalBytes` dominates the worst-case canonical encoding
  of any schema-valid value plus explicit headroom, so a schema-valid result
  can never be rejected by its own byte bound. Character maxima in schemas
  are costed at six canonical bytes per character (`\u00XX` escaping is the
  worst case); ASCII-pattern-bound strings are costed exactly.
- A delivered candidate that still exceeds its cap (only possible for
  schema-invalid output) is retained in marker-truncated bounded form, so
  the triage correction turn and the NL schema repair stay eligible for
  exactly the oversize class; nothing is silently dropped.
- The NL repair candidate bound covers the worst-case schema-valid
  `nl-decision-v1` candidate, and the final JSON-packed repair prompt fits
  BOTH repair lanes: the production direct stdin lane and the reviewed
  env-carried action-lane rollback. This is why `answer` is bounded at
  12288 characters and `free_text` at 6144: every potentially valid
  candidate is guaranteed to reach the no-tool repair model complete.
  If canonical `\u00XX` escapes would grow past the action lane's bound when
  the whole prompt is JSON-packed, the prompt uses a documented reversible
  `~HH` control-character transport (`~~` for a literal tilde) instead of
  truncating or rejecting the valid candidate.
  Schema-invalid candidates are truncated with an explicit marker according
  to the final packed prompt size, not only their raw byte size.
- The `deep-review-text-v1` verdict cap equals GitHub's 65536-character
  comment bound (a longer verdict could never post), the final transformed
  body is bounded after qualification and claim metadata are added, and it
  travels to `gh api` over stdin, never as one argv/env string.
- The NL "Conversation so far" history is bounded by turn count, per-turn
  bytes, and total bytes with explicit elision and truncation markers, so a
  long-lived card can never push the env-carried NL prompt past the
  kernel's per-string `execve` limit again. The trusted-author filter is
  byte-independent and unchanged. The task compiler applies the env cap only
  to `claude-action-compat`; oversized trusted NL instructions fail before
  model execution instead of being truncated, while stdin adapters retain the
  larger compiled-prompt cap.
- Result-artifact read caps dominate the largest possible envelope
  (`delivered` plus `final` at the largest action cap), and the correction
  path's larger reads dominate the result-artifact cap.

When adding or resizing a schema field, change the schema and, if the worst
case grows past the cap's headroom, raise that action's cap in the table;
`tests/test_size_budget.py` fails until both sides agree.

## Tools and outputs

Canonical tools are:

- `fs.read`
- `fs.grep`
- `fs.glob`
- `github.search.readonly`
- typed `final.*` schemas for adapters that need terminating final tools

Codex uses its native `turn/start.outputSchema` mechanism.
The fake adapter and future adapters use the same action schemas and trusted validation.
Natural-language primary calls pass the canonical content-bound `nl-decision-v1` schema to the pinned Claude action and prefer one terminal `structured_output` value.
That canonical schema declares JSON Schema draft-07 for Claude CLI 2.1.215 compatibility. The direct adapter also accepts the previous draft 2020-12 declaration through the same restricted keyword subset, so the trusted validation language and primary or repair behavior do not change with the dialect declaration.
If that carrier alone is absent, the bridge may parse the plain terminal `result`, but accepts it only when the object passes the same byte bound, task binding, and exact bound schema. The resulting proof records `schema-validated-terminal-result` rather than claiming native delivery. Neither native generation nor terminal JSON alone can authorize a reply or action.

Path tools reject absolute paths, traversal, symlinks, devices, sockets, and escaping canonical paths.
Results and call counts are bounded, including rejected tool attempts.
Filesystem result bounds apply to the complete canonical serialized response, including paths and envelope fields.
Read and search payloads truncate deterministically to fit that complete envelope.
Search keeps the existing repository allowlist and operation semantics but no longer needs model-facing Write or Bash on Codex.

Repository inputs are derived from the exact bound Git commit after exact-HEAD and clean index/worktree checks, rather than copied from the live filesystem shape.
Committed regular and executable blobs are packaged from the Git object database.
Safe committed relative symlinks are materialized as regular files or bounded alias trees with content-free provenance, while absolute, escaping, broken, cyclic, dirty, changing, or over-limit links and gitlinks fail closed.
The source checkout may remain branch-attached, as it is for an external default-branch `actions/checkout@v4` checkout, because AgentTask `git.detached` describes the emitted content-addressed snapshot rather than the source checkout.
Committed hidden roots such as `.agents`, `.claude`, `.github`, and `.gitignore` are ordinary signed inputs and must remain present through the hosted artifact transport.
No symlink may reach the signed handoff or hydrated model workspace.

Final-result delivery is independent of transcript retention.
A bounded Claude transcript is transferred once within the read-only reusable workflow for trusted normalization with one-day artifact retention, then only the verified normalized result artifact crosses to the trusted consumer.
The finalizer always uploads that normalized result before reporting a missing result or a pre-model harness, lifecycle, or sandbox failure as unhealthy, preserving cleanup and failure evidence without presenting the run as healthy. The Claude cross-job reduction retains a denial-only `toolDenials` diagnostic when the harness proves a permission-denied invocation: bounded tool identity plus an allowlisted command/request shape, with deterministic truncation and secret redaction. Successful tool calls add no payload to retention, and prompts, tool results, credentials, environment values, and file bodies remain excluded.
Triage normalization and the trusted card consumer share one compact-object extractor and one `target-anchor/v1` implementation. After JSON decoding, that anchor parser recognizes straight single- and double-quoted spans. Within a span, an odd run of backslashes before the matching delimiter removes only its final escape slash; all preceding slashes, mismatched quote characters, other Unicode characters, and source text remain significant. Even slash runs remain literal, malformed or mismatched delimiters cannot fall back to unquoted anchoring, and the resulting span must still occur verbatim in the immutable target after the existing case, whitespace, backtick, and asterisk normalization. Provider prose around one schema-valid compact triage object is transport metadata, not a schema failure. A VISION evidence list is empty whenever no declared criterion applies - including the documented ordinary case of a prose `VISION.md` that declares none at all - and trusted code then admits the verdict only after confirming the model itself claimed no external-source dependency; every supplied criterion remains strictly schema-validated, and the external-source binding still fails closed wherever a declared criterion does apply. Optional `source_provenance` is emitted only after a sanctioned public clone returns a non-empty resolved commit and inspected-file observations; unavailable or failed required inspection omits the object and remains conservatively inconclusive rather than emitting an invalid empty stub. A structurally valid candidate with unanchored evidence is `output.evidence_invalid`, never `output.schema_invalid` or success. Every triage evidence-quote surface (top-level evidence quotes, behavior-assertion quotes, class-B restoration quotes, and VISION criterion quotes) additionally carries the captain-fixed UTF-8 byte policy: prompts instruct at most 1024 bytes per quote, trusted validation counts bytes explicitly and accepts through 2048 bytes inclusive (`evidence_quote_utf8_byte_violations`), quotes of 1025 through 2048 bytes are valid and never correction-eligible merely for length, 2049 bytes or more fails as `output.schema_invalid`, and the schemas keep a 2048-character `maxLength` as secondary defense only because JSON Schema counts characters rather than bytes. A delivered triage candidate that fails the complete bound schema, the byte policy, or evidence anchoring remains available to its one context-equivalent correction turn - including candidates the looser advisory parser can consume.

### Context-equivalent triage correction

`agent_runtime.task_builder.correction_eligibility` is the sole correction-eligibility owner. Its exact allowlist admits only delivered primary triage candidates reported as `output.schema_invalid` or `output.evidence_invalid`; missing results and authentication, quota, rate-limit, transport, sandbox, timeout, provider, and other infrastructure failures are ineligible. This deliberately includes advisory-normalizable candidates and anchor failures because the correction retains evidence access.

Before any correction claim or spend, the builder re-verifies the content-addressed primary handoff and bound result artifact. It refuses a handoff-manifest mismatch, primary task/result hash mismatch, stale target revision, Wheelhouse source-SHA mismatch, runtime-selection drift, or correction-of-a-correction. It then copies the original AgentTask's action name, model pin, declared tools, search capability, network boundaries, output-schema binding, limits, and immutable inputs. Only the execution ID, idempotency key from the unchanged `triage.schema-repair` claim, prompt, additive `metadata.correction` binding, and `retry.repairTask: null` differ. This copied task specification proves context and read-only privilege parity; literal provider-session resume is neither required nor allowed.

The correction prompt preserves the byte-exact original prompt and appends the bounded rejected candidate as untrusted delimited data plus every structural trusted validation error. `collect_trusted_validation_errors` replays the whole bound schema, each present top-level field after a whole-value failure, the UTF-8 byte policy, and the anchor result without retaining candidate values. The model may re-inspect the original evidence and must return a complete replacement result. The bridge and card consumer validate that replacement independently against the complete bound schema, byte policy, and evidence anchors before authority.

A valid primary records `triage_consumption=primary`; a fully validated correction records `triage_consumption=corrected`. Both retain the existing authority semantics. If correction fails but the primary still normalizes and anchors, the primary records `triage_consumption=advisory` and `authority_allowed=False`; admission fails as `result.validation_failed`, and trusted projection suppresses the Accept shortcut, persisted recommendation, and auto-merge verdict. A candidate that is not advisory-consumable follows the visible repair-failed path, while a missing primary result keeps the existing no-result behavior.

The legacy no-tool `plan_triage_repair` / `build_repair_prompt` path, `triage-repair-prep` CLI, `triage.schema-repair` direct profile, and corresponding model-workflow step remain configured only as the disabled Codex inline-evidence branch and deployable rollback surface. Production Claude correction rebuilds the original triage action instead, while retaining the unchanged `triage.schema-repair` claim identity and its one-primary-plus-one-correction amplification bound.

The PR-triage recommendation basis is a discriminated union with exactly three kinds: `other`, `configured-tests-not-run`, and `configured-tests-not-green`. `other` omits `check_names`, including when green configured checks support the rationale; the two negative configured-test kinds require at least one named check. Trusted assessment admission canonicalizes the schema's absent `other.check_names` to the existing empty-list representation; a present non-empty list remains denied. Configured-test bases with an empty list remain admissible at this boundary as a pre-existing behavior, while the schema rejects that shape on the ordinary generation path; the legacy schema-repair restore path validates through `normalize_basis`, so this residual gap remains reachable through that disabled evidence lane and is tracked separately pending measurement. The production correction turn has no restore path: it produces a complete replacement result validated against the full bound schema.

The PR-triage output schema bounds the optional `class_b_restoration` object to separate corrected-defect and intended-behavior-restored strings, each with its own exact `{source, quote}` reference. Every evidence `source` is a workspace path: use exactly `target.txt`, or `target-src/<repository-relative-path>` for a checked-out target file (for example, `target-src/tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`), never a bare repository-relative path such as `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`. Only a VISION-derived behavior assertion may use exactly `vision.md`; class-B restoration remains restricted to `target.txt` or `target-src/<repository-relative-path>`. The trusted consumer verifies references against `target.txt`, the exact trusted `vision.md` only for behavior assertions, or the declared file below `target-src/`. Semantic admission is the TRIAGE MODEL'S ATTESTED JUDGMENT (captain decision, card #2148 pivot): the prompt makes the model itself judge restoration faithfulness, whether a qualifier (timing, scope, mode, audience) changes the object of restoration, and whether existing/default contract behavior changes beyond the fix, and trusted code performs NO linguistic analysis of that judgment - no vocabulary lists, token grammars, positional role rules, clause harvesting, or coverage reconciliation - because closed-class word heuristics can neither enumerate English nor distinguish an unknown adverb from an unknown noun, and the prior proposition grammar made class B unsatisfiable fleet-wide. Trusted validation is mechanical and fail-closed only: exact schema shapes and bounds, the shared evidence-quote byte policy, verbatim presence of every cited quote in its declared source (span binding), distinct restoration claims backed by distinct verified references, and exact observation/head binding. Bounded `@identifiers` survive cleanup, evidence matching, admission, and persisted state unchanged; card presentation removes the `@` only when rendering visible model text so it cannot notify an account. In-job reads use the exact workspace checkout; cross-job reads use a bounded regular-file bundle whose manifest binds every path, size, digest, and total to the exact checked-out revision, and a file over the per-file cap (or past the count/total budget) is EXCLUDED per-file in the manifest rather than voiding the artifact - a citation of an excluded path fails closed on its own, so one oversized asset can never disable every other file's semantic evidence for a repository. A bounded `behavior_assertions` array carries the model's own typed judgment of every effect the change has on an existing mode, default behavior, workflow, delivery contract, or documentation/tests, each backed by a verbatim-verified quote; the `contradicts_existing_contract` record is derived mechanically from the model's declared subject/effect enums alone - an attested changed, tightened, or new-requirement effect on a non-documentation subject denies eligibility - and is never re-derived from prose. The consumer records one versioned `behavior_admission`; missing, malformed, older, source-unbound, or contradictory records remain unavailable or unmet at the shared display and acting boundary. The legacy direct no-tool PR schema-repair output (now only the disabled codex evidence branch and rollback surface) intentionally excludes `automerge`, `vision_evidence`, and `source_provenance`; those acting claims cannot be repaired without source tools and therefore fail closed to unavailable G6, and its trusted consumer code may restore only an already-valid exact `recommendation_basis` from the original candidate. The production context-equivalent correction turn instead receives the original task's full tool, search, network, and evidence access, so it produces a COMPLETE replacement result - every acting claim included - which is then revalidated through the same bound schema, byte policy, evidence anchors, and admission before any authority.

`AgentResult.status` and normalized output events describe trusted transport, schema, and evidence validation. The later `consumer.committed` stage describes a separately bound card projection, whose triage status and behavior verdict remain independent. When a failed primary result still has a delivered candidate that advisory normalization consumes and its one correction turn failed or was unavailable, the card keeps `triage_status=succeeded` for compatibility but also records `triage_primary_status=failed`, the bounded primary error code, and `triage_consumption=advisory`; this never grants authority - the write suppresses admission (`result.validation_failed`), the Accept shortcut, any persisted recommendation, and any auto-merge verdict. While no current authority exists, the card presents that advisory-only state with explicit warning copy. If a current admitted assessment later provides a working Accept shortcut, the historical failure and consumption fields remain in non-material state for diagnostics, but their warning is suppressed so the card presents one coherent current outcome. A fully revalidated correction result instead records `triage_consumption=corrected` beside the honest failed-primary telemetry, keeps normal authority semantics, and explicitly identifies the correction as the source of authority. Each layer emits one terminal result for its own execution ID or event key rather than overwriting the other layer's evidence.

Natural-language primary calls fail closed when neither native output nor a schema-valid plain terminal result is available. A missing native carrier by itself no longer discards an otherwise schema-valid terminal result, covering the pre-2.1.205 carrier-omission class without weakening schema validation.
Genuinely absent or invalid results receive one separately claimed repair task. Candidate precedence is bounded native output, then a JSON-parseable terminal result, then a legacy raw file or terminal prose. The live prompt never asks the model to hand-serialize `decision.json`.
Natural-language repair has no GitHub or search token exposed to the model, is no-tool and single-turn, and cannot recurse. It still uses the Claude subscription credential and model tokens when it starts. Its output must pass the unchanged `nl-decision-v1` parser and schema before trusted code can reply or act.
Missing triage output and infrastructure failures (authentication, quota, rate-limit, transport, sandbox, timeout, provider) never trigger the triage correction or NL schema repair; a delivered triage candidate failing bound-schema, byte-policy, or evidence validation triggers exactly one triage correction.
Trusted code still performs normalized triage, evidence anchoring, cross-repository reference qualification, natural-language action allowlisting, card claims, revision checks, PR head checks, and auto-merge G0-G7 checks.

No model output directly authorizes or performs a GitHub action.

### The default-branch `VISION.md` contract

A non-empty prose `VISION.md` on the target's default branch is sufficient, and is the practical per-repository auto-merge opt-in the README, `docs/ONBOARDING.md`, and `wheelhouse.config.yml` describe. Vision alignment itself is the triage model's attested semantic judgment, the same split `scripts/render_card.py` already applies to behavior class: trusted code validates mechanics only.

For a prose `VISION.md`, the mechanics `render_card.triage_vision_dependency_verified` proves are the exact target/head/base/facts identity binding, the `vision_content_sha256` of the exact file, an empty `vision_evidence.applicable_criteria`, and the model's own `external_source_required: false`. Anything else - including a claimed external-source dependency without clone provenance - still strips `aligns_with_vision` and `recommend_merge`, which holds G6.

A repository may optionally adopt the stricter machine-readable form by committing exactly one single-line `<!-- wheelhouse-vision-source-dependencies: {"version":1,"complete":true,"criteria":[...]} -->` HTML comment in `VISION.md`. The `criteria` array contains 1 through 32 entries, each exactly `{id, quote_sha256, external_source_required, selector}`. An `id` is a unique 1-through-64-character lowercase identifier matching `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`; `quote_sha256` is a lowercase 64-digit hexadecimal SHA-256; and `external_source_required` is a Boolean. A selector is exactly `{"always": true}` or `{"changed_paths_any": [pattern, ...]}` with 1 through 32 repository-relative patterns. Patterns are at most 256 characters and support literal path text, `*` within one path segment, and `**` across segments (including `**/` matching zero or more leading segments); absolute paths, backslashes, empty/`.`/`..` segments, control characters, and `?`, character classes, or brace expansions are invalid.

When a declared criterion applies, the model must return applicable criteria in declaration order and quote each one verbatim. A returned quote is 8 through 500 characters, its SHA-256 must equal the declared `quote_sha256`, and it must occur exactly once after the declaration's JSON payload is removed from `VISION.md`. An `external_source_required` criterion additionally demands the same-turn `public_clone` provenance and exact-file observations described above. When no declared selector matches the changed paths, the evidence list is legitimately empty and the local-only rules apply. A malformed or partial declaration fails closed. This declaration is opt-in strictness: adding one can only ever narrow what is admitted, never widen it.

## Deadlines, cancellation, and retry

Sandboxed worker actions have a soft deadline, a cancellation grace interval, and a hard deadline.
For Claude, the separately permissioned reusable job has its own task-bound GitHub Actions timeout.
The end-to-end Claude hard deadline is unavailable because GitHub may queue the reusable job, but a delayed job still cannot execute beyond its own job timeout.
Because the pinned claude-code-action owns the model process, that job timeout - measured from job start - is the claude-action-compat lane's only enforced bound. `childExecutionTimeoutMs` therefore carries the action's hard budget rounded up to whole minutes plus a two-minute job-overhead allowance (`CLAUDE_ACTION_JOB_OVERHEAD_MS` in `agent_runtime/task_builder.py`) for the measured pre-model setup (handoff hydration, checkpoint, action setup, Claude Code install, SDK init) and post-model capture/upload, mirroring the `+ 2` minute policy the `claude-model-call` composite action documents for the claude-cli lane. Without the allowance the enforced model budget falls below the designed hard budget and the timeout can kill the action before it commits its execution file (card #1759).
The pr-review triage lane (`triage.pr.local`/`triage.pr.search`) is additionally total-first by captain decision (the card #1759 missing-triage campaign): `TRIAGE_PR_CHILD_TOTAL_MS` fixes the whole child job at exactly 15 minutes (900000 ms) because agents can be slow, the two-minute allowance lives inside that total, and the lane's hard model-execution budget is derived as total minus allowance - 13 minutes (780000 ms) - with the soft deadline keeping the 32-turn families' fixed 30-second wrap-up window below hard (750000 ms). The pinned action itself accepts no execution-timeout input, so nothing inside the job caps the model earlier than that total. Every sibling action family intentionally keeps its previous hard-first budget (triage.issue.* 7-minute total, deep-review.* 12-minute total, nl-decision.* 7-minute total, schema-repair on the supervisor-owned claude-cli lane).
Cancellation or timeout leaves the pre-invocation checkpoint available to the always-running finalizer, which emits a conservative normalized failure instead of trusting missing output.
The worker counts every logical provider request and turn before it can proceed, including continuations after rejected tool calls, disables provider and stream retries, and interrupts before continuation at an observed token ceiling or after any observed overrun.
Codex receives the task input ceiling through its pinned app-server context configuration and additional native output-schema string ceilings before the first provider request.
Durable worker checkpoints preserve observed spend, usage, and model provenance if the worker crashes or is killed after spend begins.
At the soft deadline the supervisor writes a cancellation request.
The Codex adapter sends `turn/interrupt` and waits for an interrupted terminal event.
After the grace interval the supervisor sends `SIGTERM` to the process group.
At the hard deadline it sends `SIGKILL`.

A partial final is never accepted.
Results are written to a temporary file, flushed, validated, and atomically renamed.

Current actions permit one primary candidate attempt and no runtime retry.
The exactly-one correction (or NL schema repair) is a separate task, not a provider retry; an invalid correction result is terminal for that event and at most leaves the advisory-consumable original explicitly advisory-only.
The triage correction task copies the ORIGINAL action's limits, so a pr-review correction rides the same 15-minute total the primary used rather than the retired 60-second no-tool repair budget; a literal provider conversation-session resume is not required because exact context and tool parity are proven by the copied task specification, and `session.resume` stays `forbidden`.
Fallback remains `none`.

Stable error families distinguish contract, config, selection, capability, auth, quota, provider, transport, input, provenance, tool, sandbox, lifecycle, harness, output, stale-target, source-revision, consumer, and internal failures.
Persisted messages are bounded and content-free.

## Provenance and diagnostics

Every result records:

- adapter and harness versions and digests
- protocol and schema pins
- provider and named auth profile
- auth mechanism and expected-workspace hash
- requested and observed model and effort
- cost class and data boundary
- request, capability, policy, prompt, input, output-schema, and sandbox hashes
- exact tool names and, only for proven permission denials, the bounded redacted `toolDenials` request shape
- retry and fallback decisions
- usage when available
- terminal status and stable error code

The GitHub job summary is generated by trusted code.
The model cannot author or suppress it.

Raw prompts, target inputs, tool results, app-server traffic, and auth state are not retained as diagnostics. The sole tool-call exception is the bounded denial-only `toolDenials` shape described above; it never carries the denied payload or result body.
The content-addressed Claude input handoff, bounded transcript artifact, and normalized result artifact exist only for isolated reusable-workflow job transfer and use the minimum one-day retention supported by the artifact service.
Diagnostics are scanned for GitHub tokens, model keys, bearer values, private keys, and sensitive auth fields.
The worker also compares diagnostics and final output against the exact injected credential values in memory without printing them.
Only a content-free redaction count may be retained.

If a secret exposure is suspected, disable the credential-bearing workflow first, revoke the affected credential or OAuth session, invalidate every stale runner copy, and rotate before resuming.

## Failure recovery

For triage, revision freshness and held-card recovery remain product-level safeguards outside the runtime.
A failed, cancelled, or missing result publishes an eligible held card through the existing exact-revision fail-open path.
A stale attempt cannot publish over a newer revision.
The retryable `source.revision_mismatch` code publishes the bounded "Wheelhouse updated while this request waited; please retry." explanation instead of being collapsed into a provider or schema failure.

For deep review, missing output posts the existing fixed no-verdict note and leaves the card open.

For natural-language mapping, missing or invalid output cannot produce an action.
The primary call is native first, and only bridge-validated terminal `structured_output` is a native success.
When that carrier alone is absent, a plain terminal result is accepted without repair only if it passes the unchanged byte bound, task binding, and exact `nl-decision-v1` validation; its proof records `schema-validated-terminal-result` rather than native delivery.
An absent native carrier without such a valid plain terminal result, a multiple or invalid native carrier, or a result that fails strict JSON or `nl-decision-v1` validation, receives one separately claimed repair attempt; a still-invalid repair leaves the card open with a bounded, content-free retryable failure note.
The marker-keyed failure note remains bounded and fire-once.
A normalized `source.revision_mismatch` result uses the same precise retry explanation, while unknown failures keep the generic note.
A successful mapped action still enters the existing card claim and deterministic executor.

To inspect a failure:

1. Read selection and capability negotiation before model text.
2. Confirm requested and observed provenance match.
3. Use the stable error code to identify the phase.
4. Fix configuration or the named auth profile instead of weakening a capability.
5. Never replay a natural-language action against a changed card or PR head.

## Provider changes

Claude remains the production primary until the captain approves a supported, subscription-funded, secure, and behaviorally compatible alternative.
Provider changes require an explicit reviewed plan covering credentials, billing, data boundaries, every production action path, and deterministic consumer parity.
They must preserve `fallback: none` and cannot be selected by secret presence or an environment override.

Codex is not an active target or expected future primary under the current plan.
OpenCode with Z.AI Coding Plan is deferred and disabled, with no adapter implemented.
Neither status authorizes a credential request, paid proof, workflow target, fallback, or production promise.
The provider-neutral adapter contract should be extended only after a new captain decision and without embedding provider-specific policy in runtime core.

## One-call canary and natural rollout draft

This is a plan only and does not authorize a provider call, deployment, replay, fallback, secret change, or workflow change.
Execution requires the captain to approve the exact canary task and its evidence location in a separate decision made after provider-free validation passes.

The canary uses one naturally admitted, low-risk `triage.issue.local` event whose exact event identity and target revision are cryptographically bound to its AgentTask before invocation.
Immediately before invocation, the operator must verify the durable claim is unique, the target revision is still current, the selected provider and immutable model match policy, and fallback remains `none`.
The canary permits exactly one provider request and one turn, with provider retries, schema repair, continuation, replay, and alternate-provider routing disabled.
If freshness is lost before projection, the worker must cancel when possible, publish the bound terminal stale-target result, and make no target mutation.

Success requires one spend checkpoint, one immutable AgentResult bound to the approved AgentTask, one matching terminal event projection, exact provider and model provenance, a still-current target revision at projection, one expected card update, and no duplicate claim, request, result, or target mutation.
Abort on any preflight, capability, authentication, quota, provenance, checkpoint, freshness, schema, lifecycle, cancellation, consumer, or binding discrepancy.
An aborted or failed canary is not replayed, repaired, or routed to a fallback provider under this plan.

Evidence must retain the approved action, target revision, trigger identity, AgentTask and AgentResult digests, claim and run identifiers, request and turn counts, spend checkpoint, observed provider and model provenance, bounded usage and timing, freshness checks, terminal projection digest, consumer outcome, and target mutation audit.
Credentials, raw prompts, raw transcripts, target contents, and provider responses outside the bounded AgentResult are excluded from the evidence package.
The captain must review this evidence and separately approve natural rollout before any further provider-backed event is admitted.

Natural rollout uses only newly arriving eligible events and never synthesizes or replays an event.
It admits one action family at a time in this order: issue triage, PR triage, schema repair when naturally triggered, deep review, then natural-language decisions.
Local profiles precede search-enabled profiles within each applicable family.
Each stage remains limited to its first naturally admitted event until its AgentTask, checkpoint, AgentResult, terminal projection, freshness behavior, consumer effect, and mutation audit satisfy the canary success criteria.
Promotion to the next stage requires explicit captain approval of the accumulated evidence.
Any abort criterion stops further admission, preserves existing terminal evidence, and leaves fallback and alternate providers disabled.

## Local verification

No paid model call is required for local validation.
The authoritative command list is [Local validation](../CONTRIBUTING.md#local-validation).

The fake adapter exercises all action profiles without network or credentials.
Do not run a paid live proof or mutate repository secrets without explicit approval.
