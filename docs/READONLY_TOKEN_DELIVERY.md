# READONLY_TOKEN delivery to model actions

Status: Accepted

## Decision

Production search-enabled Claude actions receive `READONLY_TOKEN` in process,
both as the action's `github_token` input and as `GH_TOKEN` in the step
environment. This is the intended credential boundary: model tooling, including
`gh` through `wheelhouse-search`, may use the token directly for anything its
permissions allow. The search steps in
[`.github/workflows/claude-model.yml`](../.github/workflows/claude-model.yml)
are the authoritative wiring.

`READONLY_TOKEN` must be a fine-grained PAT limited to public repository reads,
with no write permissions and no access to private repositories. Wheelhouse does
not manage private repositories, so no private or cross-repository private-read
credential is needed. The setup requirement is also documented in the
[`README`](../README.md#setup).

## Alternative declined

A broker-only design exists in [`agent_runtime/brokers.py`](../agent_runtime/brokers.py):
`SearchBroker` keeps the token in the trusted host and serves bounded requests
over a Unix socket to a sandboxed model adapter. That design provides stronger
credential isolation, but it was considered and declined as a replacement for
production direct delivery. Do not recommend it as one.

## Accepted tradeoff

In-process model tooling can reach the token value. GitHub log masking may
replace ordinary appearances with `***`, but it is not exfiltration-proof: a
compromised or prompt-injected task could encode the value to evade masking.
This residual exposure is understood and accepted because the credential is
limited to public reads and has no write or private-repository access. Existing
environment scrubbing and the scoped `wheelhouse-search` wrapper remain
defense-in-depth controls, not a claim that the token is unavailable in process.

## Anonymous public clone child

Only the exact `nl-decision.search` and `triage.pr.search` actions may ask
`wheelhouse-search` to clone one complete public HTTPS Git URL. Initial PR
triage uses this source-only capability to independently inspect pinned external
source when trusted default-branch `VISION.md` requires it; local-only policy
criteria remain eligible without a clone. This is separate
from the existing authenticated `gh` allowlist. The wrapper resolves the URL's host and rejects
loopback, link-local, private, reserved, metadata, or otherwise non-public
addresses before it starts Git. Git receives an explicit credential-free
environment with a fresh home and configuration, prompting and credential
helpers disabled, and no model, GitHub, cloud, or runner credentials inherited.
The shallow data-only clone is retained outside the target workspace only for
the model step, then a trusted `always()` step removes it. The model's turn is
unprivileged by construction: the pinned action runs its Bash inside bubblewrap
with `--unshare-user --cap-drop ALL`, so the broker attempts no privilege
escalation and records only an untrusted claim naming the URL, requested ref,
and resolved commit. Before cleanup, a trusted post-model step re-clones each
successful claim and derives the recorded commit, bounded manifest, and
exact-file SHA-256 observations from its own observation. Failed claims are not
cloned again: trusted code re-validates their source values and emits a fixed
failure token. A successful claim whose commit that step cannot reproduce
becomes a failure record, so a forged claim can never yield a `succeeded` one.

The retained-tree file-count and byte limits are enforced after stock Git
finishes cloning and after its `.git` administration is removed. Stock Git
may transiently download or write more pack data before that audit; this
narrow residual is accepted under the ordinary-network posture. An over-limit
retained tree fails closed and the complete clone root is deterministically
deleted. These safeguards are stricter than the official
`claude-code-action` posture because that action has no resource sandbox or
resource bounding.

### DNS rebinding residual

For arbitrary public custom Git hosts, Git resolves the hostname again between
Wheelhouse's validation and Git's connection. A host can theoretically change
from the validated public address to a non-public address in that narrow window.
Wheelhouse does not add a custom HTTP stack, address-pinning proxy, or provider
proxy to close that gap. This is the explicitly accepted residual of aligning
with the official `claude-code-action` posture. Redirect following is disabled,
metadata and other non-public answers are rejected at validation, the child has
no credentials, the hosted runner has no Wheelhouse-internal service network,
and clone time and retained data remain bounded. Neither sanctioned action may
execute cloned files or packages.
